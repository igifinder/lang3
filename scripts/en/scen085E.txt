So that's the power of the aerial fortress I've heard from the rumors.....<$FFFE>
It is quite dangerous because it can attack from the sky.<$FFFC>
Even our aerial units are sorely pressed.<$FFFE>
They just don't match the mettle of the mobile division.<$FFFE>
At that time, if this aerial fortress had made it in time, we would have been saved a lot of unnecessary trouble.<$FFFE>
Ah well.<$FFFC>
Now, just a little longer.<$FFFC>
Their attacks are already starting to lose momentum!<$FFFE>
L..lord Altemüller!<$FFFE>
What's wrong, Varna?<$FFFE>
Monsters!?<$FFFC>
Gah, at this kind of time!<$FFFE>
King Sieghart!<$FFFC>
Monsters......<$FFFE>
Monsters?<$FFFE>
While it looks like they're still far enough away.....this is bad!<$FFFE>
No, in this situation it looks like our army will profit.<$FFFE>
Because of the monsters, the Empire's aerial fortress will reduce the number of attacks it makes on us.<$FFFE>
The aerial fortress.......<$FFFE>
At this rate, the fortress might be sunk!<$FFFE>
.....But we came this far!<$FFFE>
Cease and withdraw!<$FFFC>
We'll recoup our losses, and return again!<$FFFE>
Elthlied Royal Capitol, Larcussia - Audience Hall<$FFFF>
Somehow they seem to have been driven off.<$FFFE>
Indeed.<$FFFC>
I wouldn't have thought they could come this quickly with the Lushiris Gate standing.<$FFFE>
We've got a problem, King Sieghart!<$FFFE>
What's the matter?<$FFFE>
Countless monsters have infested the border region, causing damage everywhere!<$FFFE>
In that case, let's send out our mobile division.<$FFFC>
We must stop them before the damage gets out of hand!<$FFFE>
Yes, sir!<$FFFC>
It shall be as you command.<$FFFE>
Sir Kirikaze, I have a favor to ask.<$FFFE>
What might you ask of me?<$FFFE>
I'd like you to go to Lady Jessica and discover how the monsters have been able to invade this deeply.<$FFFE>
As you command.<$FFFE>
Imperial Base along the Rigüler ~ Elthlied Borderline<$FFFF>
I can't believe these monsters came....  I didn't think that Velzeria would start a war.<$FFFE>
Velzeria, the Kingdom of Demons.<$FFFC>
Do they plan on ending the age of man?<$FFFE>
Foul news, Your Excellency!<$FFFE>
What's happened?  Your face has become grim.<$FFFE>
It's imperative that we return to the capitol!<$FFFC>
The Emperor, the Emperor has passed away!<$FFFE>
Christ IV....dead!?<$FFFE>
The national funeral rites are being held the day after tomorrow.<$FFFC>
Please, let us return to the Imperial capitol with all haste.<$FFFE>
Uncle.......<$FFFC>
This happened much too quickly......<$FFFE>
Your Excellency, you think he was poisoned after all?<$FFFE>
I can't say for certain.<$FFFC>
But if so, I'll never forgive that damnable Paul.....<$FFFE>
Very well, Varna, let's return to the Imperial capitol!<$FFFE>
Yes, sir!<$FFFE>
Emaillink, I'll trust you and Geier to manage things in our absence.<$FFFE>
It seems that, once again, the monsters have managed to leave the confines of Velzeria.<$FFFE>
I'll see that they stay on the other side of our border!<$FFFE>
