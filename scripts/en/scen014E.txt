Lushiris Western Gate<$FFFF>
There's nothing outside sir!<$FFFE>
In that case we will expand the search.<$FFFC>
Split up into groups and search the interiors for the sacred beast!<$FFFE>
Barral Soldiers!?<$FFFC>
So the enemy has come to this place as well.<$FFFE>
I just hope that warden Jügler is still safe...<$FFFE>
Jügler?<$FFFE>
Yes.<$FFFC>
But unlike us Jügler is not a human being.<$FFFE>
Ehh?<$FFFC>
But if he's not human, just what is he?<$FFFE>
Jügler is a saintly animal that serves the goddess.<$FFFE>
My, I can't wait to meet such a intriguing creature.<$FFFE>
First the Barral troops have to be repelled, don't you think?<$FFFC>
It is fortunate that they have just arrived.<$FFFE>
Surely Jügler has hid himself somewhere in the temple.<$FFFE>
Ugh, so they really did show up.<$FFFC>
We have to locate the beast before they do!<$FFFE>
Yes sir!<$FFFE>
All spare troops take care of those nuisances!<$FFFE>
Understood!<$FFFE>
Saintly animal Jügler....<$FFFD>
What kind of animal is he exactly?<$FFFE>
Jügler has the ability of metamorphosis, allowing him to take various shapes.<$FFFE>
Jügler has the ability of metamorphosis, allowing him to take various shapes.<$FFFE>
Dammit!<$FFFC>
What a persistent prey!<$FFFE>
Damn!<$FFFD>
The sacred beast still haven't been found yet?<$FFFE>
The search continues!<$FFFE>
Hurry up!<$FFFC>
With utmost haste!<$FFFE>
Dammit!<$FFFD>
Where on earth could that beast be!?<$FFFE>
The enemy is targeting Jügler!<$FFFC>
Everyone, protecting Jügler takes first priority!<$FFFE>
Of course.<$FFFC>
We mustn't allow them to kill him!<$FFFE>
That's right.<$FFFE>
If we fail here against Barral, the restoration of Larcuss will be utterly impossible!<$FFFD>
We simply must win!<$FFFE>
That's the spirit!<$FFFE>
Are you alright Jügler!?<$FFFC>
Just hold out a little while longer!<$FFFE>
Grrr...<$FFFE>
Maybe here?<$FFFE>
Damn!<$FFFC>
Just where could it be?<$FFFE>
!<$FFFE>
<$F702>Nope, he's not here.<$FFFE>
!<$FFFE>
<$F702>He must be in a different room.<$FFFE>
!<$FFFE>
<$F702>Sigh...nothing.<$FFFE>
Keep at it, he has to be somewhere!<$FFFE>
!<$FFFE>
<$F702>Guess what...<$FFFE>
He's not here....<$FFFE>
!<$FFFE>
<$F702>Damn it all!<$FFFE>
Search the whole place!<$FFFE>
Just where is he?<$FFFE>
A treasure box was found!<$FFFD>
Divine Blessing was obtained!<$FFFE>
The treasure box was opened!<$FFFE>
The treasure box was a fake...<$FFFE>
A treasure box was found!<$FFFD>
The treasure box was opened!<$FFFE>
Ambrosia was obtained!<$FFFE>
The treasure box was a fake...<$FFFE>
Don't murder Jügler!<$FFFE>
You must be their commander!<$FFFE>
Damn this!<$FFFE>
Tia, is unbeatable!<$FFFE>
Defeat is not an option!<$FFFE>
Hihihi!<$FFFC>
You shouldn't have come here!<$FFFE>
I wish it wouldn't have to come to this!<$FFFE>
Don't you dare to set foot onto this holy ground...<$FFFE>
Going to battle is such barbarism.<$FFFC>
However you will not be permitted to desecrate this holy site.<$FFFE>
Jüggler fight graaa!<$FFFC>
You cannot simply defeat!<$FFFE>
I hold no grudge against you, but I'm afraid you'll have to die!<$FFFE>
The sacred beast is aware of the danger it's in!<$FFFE>
Don't let it get away!<$FFFE>
It is unfortunate but your life ends now!<$FFFE>
Die, die, die!<$FFFE>
Your luck has run out, having me as your opponent!<$FFFE>
I can still...<$FFFC>
You have to do it...<$FFFE>
Papa...<$FFFE>
Everyone, I'm sorry...<$FFFE>
That's the extent of my power...<$FFFE>
I'm useless...<$FFFE>
Oh?<$FFFE>
My apologies...<$FFFE>
Lushiris...<$FFFE>
Gua...<$FFFC>
No please, don't...<$FFFE>
Grrr...<$FFFC>
Stop it...<$FFFE>
Jügler!?<$FFFE>
We did it!<$FFFC>
Brace yourself Dark Knight!<$FFFC>
The sacred beast is no more!<$FFFE>
Curses!<$FFFC>
The Sacred beast...<$FFFE>
Never could I be beaten like this...General Dios...<$FFFE>
Captain Ruud please retreat...<$FFFE>
...Forgive me.<$FFFE>
...General Dios...if only..you would have been in command...instead of that heinous Dark Knight...<$FFFD>
Damn!<$FFFE>
Guaaaa!<$FFFE>
I wanted to see my son...once more...<$FFFE>
What folly!<$FFFE>
That's not how..it..should..be...<$FFFE>
Where are all my friends now...<$FFFE>
UUwaaa!<$FFFE>
Fo...Fools...<$FFFE>
Captain Ruud...!<$FFFE>
I like dying...<$FFFE>
Never!<$FFFE>
My horsemanship was...<$FFFE>
Wh..What?<$FFFC>
I can't be defeated like this...<$FFFE>
Next time I want to be born in a world without war...<$FFFE>
General...where are..you...<$FFFE>
I couldn't...hurt an animal...<$FFFE>
Not in a place like this...!<$FFFE>
All my troops have been defeated!?<$FFFC>
How could such a thing...<$FFFD>
But no matter I'll even fight on alone!<$FFFC>
And I will prove my worth to that conceited Dark Knight!<$FFFE>
Phew.<$FFFC>
Somehow we made it through.<$FFFE>
Sir [diehardt's name], I can only applaud you for your fine commanding.<$FFFE>
Sir [diehardt's name]...<$FFFC>
