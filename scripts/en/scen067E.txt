Lushiris Gate ~ Western Gate<$FFFF>
Thank you.<$FFFC>
Your help was much appreciated.<$FFFE>
Wow!<$FFFC>
He's so fluffy-fluffy!<$FFFE>
You wouldn't mind if I'd touched you too right?<$FFFE>
My, you really are fluffy, aren't you.<$FFFE>
.....Guu.<$FFFE>
Good to see you again, Jügler.<$FFFE>
Master Fauvel, Mistress Sophia.<$FFFD>
I am very glad to see both of you are well.<$FFFE>
Both of us were also surrounded by enemies, until Sir [diehardt's name] and company came and saved us.<$FFFE>
The demons of Velzeria are beginning to invade Larcuss.<$FFFD>
We've got to renew the Lushiris Gate as soon as possible.<$FFFE>
....I see.<$FFFC>
I shall open the gate immediately.<$FFFE>
Please do.<$FFFE>
Holy light of Lady Lushiris, grant me the power to open this gate, to drive back the powers of darkness.<$FFFE>
Wonderful.....<$FFFE>
A pillar of light is shining in the northern sky, too!<$FFFE>
Somehow, the northern gate must have been liberated, as well.<$FFFE>
Guess so.<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
Lord Raymond must have been successful.<$FFFE>
Right now, this country faces troublesome times.<$FFFC>
I Jügler, will help you too!<$FFFE>
Jügler joined the part!<$FFFE>
My, even Mr. Fluffy-fluffy is coming with us!<$FFFE>
Nice to have you with us, Jügler.<$FFFE>
Gr....<$FFFE>
Lushiris Gate ~ Center<$FFFF>
I have been waiting for your return, Lord Raymond.<$FFFD>
The gates in all four directions have been opened.<$FFFE>
Oh, so [diehardt's name] and company succeeded after all.<$FFFE>
I shall open the Lushiris Gate, so that the power of Lady Lushiris shall ward against demons from now on.<$FFFE>
Shigna Noik Rahji.<$FFFE>
Grant the divine protection of Lady Lushiris to this land.<$FFFC>
Protect it against the aggression of all who are turned to evil. <$FFFE>
Shigna Noik Rahji Di Lushiris!<$FFFE>
Ohhh!<$FFFE>
Now we should be protected against the invasions of the demons.<$FFFE>
We should not take too much comfort from this.<$FFFD>
It is true that this light shall ward against ordinary demons.<$FFFD>
However, among the demons there are those with great strength that can act even in the face of this holy light.<$FFFD>
Soon we will likely find some of them attacking us.<$FFFD>
At that time, we must have the power to overcome such demons.<$FFFE>
If that's the case, we've got to make some kind of preparations.<$FFFE>
Are you familiar with the Haja no Ken?<$FFFD>
It is a sword shrouded in legend, said to hold the power to vanquish those sworn to evil.<$FFFD>
It would be best if we could get ahold of it.<$FFFE>
The Haja no Ken, eh......<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
But, our main forces still have to fight against the Empire.<$FFFE>
And so, I guess....<$FFFE>
Yes.<$FFFC>
I'll have to entrust this task to [diehardt's name] and company.<$FFFD>
This will be a much better use of [diehardt's name];s mobile division; it would be a waste to squander them in the fight with the Empire.<$FFFE>
So, let's dispatch a messenger.<$FFFE>
Velzeria Castle<$FFFF>
So the Lushiris Gate has been revived....<$FFFE>
Now none but our strongest demons can enter that country.<$FFFC>
Now we'll need a new plan.<$FFFE>
All of the countries haven't been worn out from the fighting.<$FFFC>
Indeed, the Empire is still much too strong.<$FFFE>
If that's the case, I know a human who will suit our needs well.<$FFFC>
If we use him, we should be able to assassinate the Field Marshal.....<$FFFE>
Kill Altemüller...?<$FFFC>
Intriguing, go ahead and try!<$FFFE>
Yes, Master.<$FFFE>
In all likelihood, if the ever-popular Altemüller is killed and replaced by that idiot Imperial prince, the Empire will be embroiled in the chaos of the succession.<$FFFE>
That chaos will create a gap for us to enter....<$FFFC>
Hohoho!<$FFFE>
<$FFFF>
