Scenario ~ 06<$FFFC>
"Enemies on all Sides"<$FFFE>
Now that Luna, daughter of the genius tactician Baron Torrand,<$FFFC>
has joined [diehardt's name] and company, the mobile division<$FFFC>
has come between the forces of the RigÅEer Empire and Barral<$FFFC>
Kingdom in order to execute the Baron's cunning plan.<$FFFE>
Fighting between both countries there would deflect notice from<$FFFC>
the Larcussians' plans, buying some time to realize their goal.<$FFFE>
*Conditions for Victory<$FFFC>
 -Complete annihilation of enemies<$FFFC>
 -Successfully retreating with all allies to the opposite shore<$FFFC>
  after initiating combat between the Imperial and Barral forces<$FFFC>
*Condition for Defeat<$FFFC>
 -Death of [diehardt's name]<$FFFE>
Near the Borderline between Barral and the Rig¸ler Empire<$FFFF>
Sir [diehardt's name]<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
An enemy base is just a little farther.<$FFFE>
Understood.<$FFFD>
Let's execute the first part of the Baron's plan.<$FFFD>
That will buy us enough time to sneak past and visit the sorceress, Jessica, at the Lushiris Gate.<$FFFE>
You're talking about getting our enemies to fight each other, right?<$FFFE>
Indeed.<$FFFD>
Lord Raymond is still fighting against Colcia.<$FFFD>
If we can trick the Empire into fighting against Barral, we'll be in a much better position.<$FFFE>
But, how can we get them to fight each other?<$FFFE>
Ahead of us is a borderline manned by the Imperial and the Barral armies.<$FFFD>
If we attack both of their armies simultaneously there, and quickly retreat, they'll fight amongst themselves.<$FFFE>
Now I get it!<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
Each will think the other has tried to invade, and we can move on in the aftermath!<$FFFE>
Precisely.<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
Let's go, everyone!<$FFFE>
<$FFFF>
