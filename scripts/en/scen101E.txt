Geriord...<$FFFE>
How could Geriord be the Dark Knight...<$FFFD>
Just what is the meaning of this...?<$FFFE>
Is he the one you had to leave behind in Laffel?<$FFFE>
Yeah....<$FFFE>
So how did he end up as the Dark Knight then?<$FFFE>
I don't know. Geriord was the one who taught me how to wield a sword.<$FFFD>
I have only fond memories of him being a kind man, my ideal of what a knight should be like.<$FFFD>
...He was like an elder brother to me...<$FFFE>
Seemingly both Geriord and King Wilder have undergone a complete change.<$FFFD>
This cannot be mere coincidence.<$FFFE>
....<$FFFE>
What is the matter, Lady Jessica?<$FFFE>
...Hmm.<$FFFD>
It is faint, but the bewitchment of the Demon Family can be felt emitted from his body..<$FFFE>
Seriously, even this is the work of Velzeria?<$FFFE>
We have to meet King Wilder to be sure about it.<$FFFD>
If King Wilder's insanity is due to the influence of Velzeria, we have to try to rid him of it with all means necessary.<$FFFE>
But, Lady Jessica.<$FFFD>
If we try to cleanse him with magic wouldn't his life be in danger too?<$FFFE>
And to think that we already have taken down Böser and his generals...<$FFFE>
Even I don't know everything about Velzeria's true power.<$FFFD>
When worse comes to worse, we may won't be able to save King Wilder or find the cause for his madness.<$FFFE>
Nonetheless Barrel should be our next destination.<$FFFE>
...Yes, we're going to Barral.<$FFFD>
We have to uncover the truth about all of this!<$FFFE>
Aerial Fortress<$FFFF>
Hmph, how tiresome.<$FFFE>
Lord Altemüller.<$FFFC>
By the looks of it Geier has abandoned his subordinates and fled.<$FFFE>
Deserting ones subordinates like this.<$FFFC>
It fits Geier well.<$FFFD>
But the only thing that matters is that the flying fortress is ours to command now.<$FFFC>
It seems as if Elthlead was delayed somehow too, how convenient..<$FFFE>
Emaillink make preparations for the assault on the imperial capitol!<$FFFE>
As you wish.<$FFFE>
Hehehe...Hahahaha!<$FFFE>
...<$FFFE>
