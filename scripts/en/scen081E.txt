Father!<$FFFE>
....Lewin.<$FFFC>
You've become quite a wondrous young man.<$FFFE>
So I've been saved by my own son, eh.<$FFFE>
It wasn't me alone.<$FFFC>
We only succeeded because of everyone's aid.....<$FFFE>
I suppose so.<$FFFE>
.....[diehardt's name].<$FFFC>
It looks like you're doing well.<$FFFE>
My own troops were pretty much annihilated.<$FFFC>
I feel guilty, but I'd like to entrust the liberation of the royal capital to you all.<$FFFE>
Yes, sir.<$FFFC>
I've been joined by many inspirational comrades.<$FFFE>
We'll do whatever we can to pull through and finish this, now that it's down to us.<$FFFE>
I'm so glad.<$FFFC>
I'll trust you to look after Lewin from here on.<$FFFE>
Milord Viscount, you're pushing your body too much.<$FFFC>
Please leave the rest to us, and rest up.<$FFFE>
Of course, thanks.<$FFFE>
Everyone, thank you so much.<$FFFD>
Riffany, [diehardt's name].<$FFFC>
Now, it's our turn to save your parents.<$FFFE>
Oh, you're right.<$FFFD>
I sure hope my father and mother are safe and sound.<$FFFE>
Me, too.<$FFFC>
Let's head to Larcussia right away!<$FFFD>
....Father, Mother, please hold on a little longer.<$FFFC>
We're coming to save you now!<$FFFE>
Rig¸ler Imperial Castle ~ Emperor Christ's Sickroom<$FFFF>
So, after this I'll just be heading home with the aerial fortress, eh.<$FFFE>
Oho, Your Majesty, Paul.<$FFFE>
So proper to use such a distant greeting, General Geier.<$FFFC>
I've something I'd like to ask you.<$FFFE>
Well, what matter might that be?<$FFFE>
Hmm.<$FFFC>
From what I've heard, you don't seem to hold AltemÅEler in the highest regard.<$FFFE>
No, I, ah...<$FFFE>
There's no need to hide your feelings on this.<$FFFC>
The fact of the matter is, I hate that bastard as well.<$FFFE>
And my father won't last much longer with his illness.<$FFFE>
When he succumbs, I'll become the emperor.....<$FFFC>
When that time comes, I think the one who should hold the office of Field Marshal is you, Geier.<$FFFE>
Me!?<$FFFE>
But, to do that, we must come across some excuse to remove AltemÅEler from his post.<$FFFE>
If he should make some mistake in his current defense of the Royal capitol, it would undermine his credibility.<$FFFE>
So, what do you think?<$FFFC>
Is there any reason you can come up with for discontinuing the use of the aerial fortress?<$FFFE>
So you're saying that you would prefer for me not to return with the aerial fortress?<$FFFE>
Exactly.<$FFFC>
With the might of the aerial fortress, we can retake the royal capital at any time.<$FFFE>
You can then reclaim the city of Larcussia after that bastard loses it, using the aerial fortress.<$FFFE>
He'll be dismissed, and you'll be promoted.<$FFFC>
Like that strategy?<$FFFE>
....I think Your Majesty might be underestimating that brat's power.<$FFFC>
Even without the fortress, he'll probably still be able to hold the royal capitol.<$FFFE>
What!<$FFFC>
If that's true, what would you recommend....<$FFFE>
.....Well, if his supply line were severed, he won't be able to sustain his side of the battle no matter how great a commander he is.....<$FFFE>
In that case, halt his supply line!<$FFFE>
But, I have no excuse to stop it.<$FFFE>
...Nonetheless, if the supply line defenders were annihilated by troops disguised as bandits, wouldn't that work to stop the supply line?<$FFFE>
Ohh!<$FFFC>
Ohh!!<$FFFE>
In that case, leave the matter of the aerial fortress to me!<$FFFC>
If it is damaged enough, it won't be able to take flight.<$FFFE>
