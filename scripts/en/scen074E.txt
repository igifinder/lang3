Scenario ~ 17<$FFFC>
"Operation:  Recapture Laffel"<$FFFE>
By attacking Fort Rogier, [diehardt's name]'s mobile division<$FFFC>
successfully drew the Dark Knight from Laffel, allowing them<$FFFC>
to switch over to their true goal, the recapture of Laffel.<$FFFE>
However, while the mobile division makes way to Laffel, the<$FFFC>
war situation on Lord Raymond's front has taken a serious<$FFFC>
turn for the worse.<$FFFE>
*Condition for Victory<$FFFC>
 -Defeat of Flaire<$FFFC>
*Condition for Defeat<$FFFC>
 -Death of [diehardt's name]<$FFFE>
Barral Territory ~ Fort Rogier<$FFFF>
What's going on here?<$FFFC>
The fort was captured, but isn't occupied?<$FFFC>
What the hell.....<$FFFE>
....Hurry on back.<$FFFE>
Sir?<$FFFE>
Don't you see?<$FFFC>
It's a diversion.<$FFFE>
Outskirts of Larcussia ~ Currently Imperial Territory<$FFFF>
Whoah!<$FFFC>
Just a little more!<$FFFE>
Perfect!<$FFFC>
Now, victory is ours!<$FFFE>
Sir Kirikaze, you have done well.<$FFFE>
No, no, I've done little at all.<$FFFE>
It was more the high spirits of the soldiers.<$FFFC>
That's the real reason we've won.<$FFFE>
W..what the!<$FFFC>
What's that!?<$FFFE>
What's going on!?<$FFFE>
I didn't want to have to rely on this kind of thing, since I find the amount of damage it lets loose excessive.<$FFFE>
Don't think too badly of me.<$FFFE>
What is that strange contraption?<$FFFE>
I don't know.<$FFFC>
I've never heard of anything that resembles that!<$FFFE>
Go for it, magically-propelled giant soldier Galshook!<$FFFC>
Show them the magical might of the ancients!<$FFFE>
Target acquisition.....completed.<$FFFC>
Powering up generator.<$FFFE>
....Magic power replenished.<$FFFC>
Ready to fire magic cannon.<$FFFE>
Attaaaaaack!<$FFFE>
Uwaa!<$FFFE>
What the hell was that!?<$FFFE>
This is very bad!<$FFFC>
All troops, retreat!<$FFFE>
Too late for that!<$FFFE>
Airship Fleet ~ Deck of the Flagship<$FFFF>
General Geier.<$FFFC>
It seems the Galshook made it in time.<$FFFE>
Hmmph, of course it did.<$FFFC>
Because we had the airship fleet, I knew we'd be able to transport even that giant monster in two days.<$FFFE>
And you were right as always.<$FFFE>
Now, let's begin our own attack.<$FFFE>
Yes, sir!<$FFFE>
