You did it, Kirikaze.<$FFFE>
Thanks to everyone's help, I was able to defeat that witch.<$FFFE>
I don't know how best to express my gratitude......<$FFFE>
No need to worry about that.<$FFFC>
We're all friends, after all.<$FFFE>
Speaking of which, Kirikaze,<$FFFC>
what do you plan to do now?<$FFFE>
Since you were able to avenge your lord, will you return now?<$FFFE>
No.<$FFFC>
We may have defeated Ferakia, but the puppeteer pulling her strings, Böser, remains.<$FFFE>
Unless Böser is defeated, other monsters will eventually attack again.<$FFFE>
Until Böser is overthrown, I will travel together with you all.<$FFFE>
I see.<$FFFE>
In that case, we have to defeat Böser and end this matter once and for all.<$FFFE>
I shall make it my new duty.<$FFFC>
Come, let's move on!<$FFFE>
All right, everyone.<$FFFC>
None of us can rest until Böser is defeated!<$FFFE>
