"Shapeshiftress Ferakia"<$FFFE>
Ferakia's attempt to throw Elthlead into chaos by taking<$FFFC>
the form of a royal claimant was easily seen through<$FFFC>
thanks to the power of the holy sword, the Langrisser.<$FFFE>
[diehardt's name] and company have taken this<$FFFC>
chance to start their journey to Velzeria to overthrow<$FFFC>
the leader of the demons, Böser.<$FFFE>
However, in a swamp on the way, the Shapeshiftress<$FFFC>
Ferakia lay in wait, hoping for a chance to get<$FFFC>
bloody revenge, for the shameful defeat suffered.<$FFFE>
*Condition for Victory<$FFFC>
 -Defeat of Ferakia<$FFFC>
*Condition for Defeat<$FFFC>

Fort Hakusan ~ 15 Years Ago<$FFFF>
Grr!<$FFFE>
Opposition is futile!<$FFFE>
Eeii!<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
Secret sword technique, Shitsufuuzan! (Rapid Wind Death)<$FFFE>
Milord!<$FFFD>
Milord!<$FFFC>
Answer me!<$FFFE>
Ugh......<$FFFC>
Gu..guhuu!<$FFFE>
Ahaha!<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
Now this country is finished!<$FFFE>
H..how vexing....<$FFFE>
Milord!<$FFFE>
You're too late.<$FFFC>
Since you only reached here now, you were too slow to protect your ward!<$FFFE>
You!<$FFFC>
Demonic wretch!<$FFFE>
Bah!<$FFFC>
You actually managed to wound me.....<$FFFE>
But, whatever.<$FFFC>
Since this country is finished anyway, it doesn't matter if I let go one miserable human!<$FFFE>
Milord.....my humble apologies!<$FFFE>
My lord, you kept me in your service for so long, yet I failed to protect not only your wife and only son, Shoutarou, but also you.....<$FFFE>
..<$fe><$3c>..<$fe><$3c>..<$fe><$3c>Milord,<$fe><$3c><$FFFC>
I, the dishonored Kirikaze, wish to postpone committing honorable suicide for a little while longer.<$FFFE>
Please, let me live in shame until I defeat Your enemy, that cursed witch!<$FFFE>
Road to Velzeria<$FFFF>
..<$fe><$3c>..<$fe><$3c>..<$fe><$3c>..<$fe><$3c>..<$fe><$3c>.<$FFFE>
What's wrong, Kirikaze?<$FFFE>
..<$fe><$3c>..<$fe><$3c>..<$fe><$3c>..<$fe><$3c>Sir,<$FFFC>
It's nothing, nothing at all.<$FFFD>
I was just recalling the days of yore.<$FFFD>
....Anyhow, it seems to have gotten colder.<$FFFC>
Velzeria must be only a little farther.<$FFFE>
Our scouts have returned.<$FFFE>
I see.<$FFFC>
So, what's the word?<$FFFE>
They report sightings of monsters in the marshland ahead.<$FFFD>
The marshland is covered with snow.<$FFFC>
It's the perfect place for an ambush.<$FFFE>
They'll probably take advantage of that.<$FFFC>
Apparently we haven't defeated them enough times to route them yet.<$FFFE>
Au contraire, the facts would suggest that they are desperate, as this is their last chance.<$FFFE>
They're frantically trying to keep us away from Velzeria.<$FFFE>
Hmm......<$FFFE>
What do you say?<$FFFE>
But, it'll be fine.<$FFFE>
We need to be careful.<$FFFE>
We might be in over our heads.<$FFFE>
But, we'll be fine.<$FFFC>
Everyone, cheer up!<$FFFE>
Right.<$FFFE>
Yeah!<$FFFC>
Tia will also do her best!<$FFFE>
As will I.<$FFFE>
We'll be fighting on a battleground of their choosing.<$FFFC>
We need to be very careful.<$FFFE>
Indeed.<$FFFE>
I agree.<$FFFE>
This time, it looks like we might be in over our heads.....<$FFFE>
No way, [diehardt's name]!<$FFFC>
What are you saying!?<$FFFE>
That's right.<$FFFC>
Aren't you our commander?<$FFFE>
Really!<$FFFC>
This isn't like you at all, [diehardt's name]!<$FFFE>
....S..sorry......<$FFFE>
