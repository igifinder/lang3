Baron Torrand's Mansion<$FFFF>
Could this truly be how the famous strategist does battle?<$FFFE>
Until now, there was no resistance at all...<$FFFC>
Or is this a trap?<$FFFE>
Baron!<$FFFE>
It seems like we have been surrounded.<$FFFC>
First let go those that shouldn't get involved with the fighting...<$FFFE>
If you wish to evacuate the civilians,<$FFFC>
we will not interfere with them.<$FFFC>
During the evacuation the attack will be halted.<$FFFE>
You show no signs of planing something ignoble.<$FFFC>
For that you have my gratitude.<$FFFE>
We as well have no intention of spilling the blood of the innocent.<$FFFE>
So even some of nowadays youths, have a sense of honor.<$FFFE>
Commence the evacuation of all civilians.<$FFFE>
Yessir!<$FFFE>
I have an announcement for all troops!<$FFFC>
While the evacuation of the civilians takes place, all hostile acts are prohibited!<$FFFD>
Any unordered acts of aggression will be judged the same as treason against the Empire!<$FFFE>
General Emaillink!<$FFFE>
What is it?<$FFFE>
Remnants of the Larcussian army are approaching from the forest to the south.<$FFFE>
Could it be the unit that fought with Geier?<$FFFD>
You and your troops should take positions at the assigned location and take care of the mobile division.<$FFFC>
Most importantly do so, if I should fail to occupy the mansion.<$FFFE>
Understood!<$FFFE>
Here we are.<$FFFC>
This road leads directly to the mansion.<$FFFE>
We made it here sooner than I thought.<$FFFE>
Let's meet up with the Baron quickly to convey Lord Raymond's proposal.<$FFFE>
...I'm afraid it won't be that simple.<$FFFE>
Uwa! The imperial troops are here!<$FFFE>
Oh my, they sure are persistent!<$FFFE>
In that case we must hurry even more!<$FFFE>
Please wait, Sir [diehardt's name].<$FFFC>
Something is suspicious, their numbers seem insufficient to invade the mansion.<$FFFE>
I'm certain there are more enemies laying in wait somewhere close.<$FFFC>
Especially the forest would be a suitable terrain for such purposes.<$FFFE>
...I see.<$FFFC>
Thanks for the warning, Miss Luna.<$FFFE>
Everyone! It is to be expected that the imperials have set up an ambush for us!<$FFFC>
Advance with utmost caution!<$FFFE>
Thank you, Sir [diehardt's name].<$FFFE>
One more thing, I would appreciate it if you just called me Luna.<$FFFE>
I got it, Luna.<$FFFC>
Now, let's move out to aid the Baron!<$FFFE>
Well then, you should make good your escape now.<$FFFE>
B..But...<$FFFE>
You'll be fine.<$FFFC>
The imperial General we are facing has a high sense for humanity.<$FFFE>
While you escape we won't take as much as another step forward.<$FFFC>
You have my word.<$FFFE>
Alright.<$FFFC>
Baron, we will pray for your victory.<$FFFE>
That will certainly help.<$FFFE>
General Emaillink.<$FFFC>
The evacuation of the civilians seems to be complete.<$FFFE>
Alright, continue the attack!<$FFFE>
Yessir!<$FFFE>
Now, what could that countermeasure possibly be...?<$FFFC>
If I can't think of anything fast, I'll be spiked with arrows.<$FFFE>
Well then, take this chance to finally storm the mansion!<$FFFE>
Affirmative!<$FFFE>
Now it's up to us to return the favor!<$FFFE>
Alright, the water is entering...<$FFFE>
The water gate was closed therefore the water level is rising, he tries using buoyancy to cross over the gates...<$FFFE>
That youth is really something else.<$FFFE>
Just a little bit more and we can pass over the gate.<$FFFC>
It's about time to claim victory for us.<$FFFE>
Yeaahh!<$FFFE>
Crap!<$FFFC>
We didn't expect them to come this way.<$FFFD>
There is no use in hiding anymore.<$FFFC>
It can't be helped, charge at the enemy!<$FFFE>
Yes sir, understood!<$FFFE>
So there was an ambush after all.<$FFFC>
If it weren't for Luna's warning this could have gotten pretty bad.<$FFFE>
Thank you Luna.<$FFFC>
You really saved us.<$FFFE>
Not at all...this was nothing to take note of...<$FFFE>
The enemy seems to employ many cavalry units.<$FFFE>
Be careful, cavalry can take out infantry units with ease.<$FFFC>
The best strategy would be to send spearmen against them.<$FFFE>
Strategy?<$FFFC>
I heard something about that before, but I guess I was sick at that lesson...<$FFFE>
All I remember is that each type of unit has its strong points and weaknesses...<$FFFD>
That's right, mounted soldiers are strong against common infantry units but will be at a disadvantage against spearmen.<$FFFD>
Spearmen on the other hand, don't fare well against other infantry units.<$FFFE>
As one would expect of the daughter of a genius strategist's.<$FFFC>
With those information we should be able to do battle more effectively.<$FFFE>
Indeed.<$FFFC>
I'll make sure to put this knowledge to good use...<$FFFE>
Little by little.<$FFFC>
Let them exhaust their strength gradually.<$FFFE>
Yessir!<$FFFE>
Interesting.<$FFFC>
The Baron shows his wits.<$FFFE>
You there, division just outside the castle, close the water gate and stop the flow of the river!<$FFFE>
Yessir!<$FFFC>
Right away!<$FFFE>
Wear them down little by little...<$FFFC>
One who thinks only all out war can lead to victory is gravely mistaken.<$FFFE>
Yes!<$FFFE>
Charge!<$FFFC>
If we don't take over the mansion swiftly, enemy reinforcements will show up!<$FFFE>
Understood!<$FFFE>
Hahahaha!<$FFFC>
We've got you now!<$FFFC>
All out Attack!<$FFFE>
Yessir, as you wish!<$FFFE>
Curses!<$FFFC>
We should've listened to Luna's warning...<$FFFD>
It can't be helped.<$FFFC>
Now we've got no other choice but to deal with it.<$FFFE>
We've made it to safety...<$FFFE>
Baron.<$FFFC>
All civilians have been evacuated to safety.<$FFFE>
Good.<$FFFC>
Brace yourselves for the attack of the imperial troops.<$FFFC>
We will show them our fighting spirit.<$FFFD>
Avoid contact with the enemy and fall back to my position,<$FFFC>
since you are at a disadvantage against their advancing infantry.<$FFFE>
Yessir!<$FFFE>
*Huff*...that was scary...<$FFFE>
Baron Torrand.<$FFFC>
We are out of danger...<$FFFE>
Baron.<$FFFC>
All civilians have evacuated to safety.<$FFFE>
Good.<$FFFC>
Brace yourselves for the attack of the imperial troops.<$FFFC>
Let's show them our fighting spirit.<$FFFD>
Avoid contact with the enemy and fall back to my position,<$FFFC>
since you are at a disadvantage against their advancing cavalry.<$FFFE>
Yessir!<$FFFE>
Huh!?<$FFFC>
What is happening!?<$FFFE>
Your plan was a success!<$FFFC>
The mouse was caught in the trap.<$FFFE>
So it worked, excellent.<$FFFC>
Take out the commander while he's trapped!<$FFFE>
Yessir!<$FFFE>
...Blasted!<$FFFC>
There has to be some kind of mechanism to open it.<$FFFE>
What are we going to do now, General?<$FFFE>
Don't panic.<$FFFC>
Undoubtedly there is a counter-measure.<$FFFE>
The floodgate was closed!<$FFFE>
Good, resume the assault on the mansion now!<$FFFE>
Yessir!<$FFFE>
Now, using the river and the moat of this mansion,<$FFFC>
we should be getting some interesting results...<$FFFE>
?!<$FFFC>
The enemy has broken through our reinforcements?<$FFFC>
Being caught in a pincer attack would be perilous...<$FFFD>
You knight there!<$FFFC>
Surely you must be their commander.<$FFFC>
Tell me, what your name is?<$FFFE>
Fall back to the inner part of the mansion.<$FFFC>
Let me take care of those infantry units coming from our flanks.<$FFFD>
Spearmen, block off that path and take down the enemy General if he breaks out!<$FFFE>
Just leave him to our care!<$FFFE>
Good.<$FFFC>
Don't do anything to endanger your lives, we just have to hold out until my daughter comes back.<$FFFE>
Surrounded by three trees there is some vacant land.<$FFFD>
There's a little spirit in the centre, gazing at you with curiosity.<$FFFE>
What do you want to do?<$FFFE>
Smile<$FFFE>
Do your signature pose<$FFFE>
Do nothing<$FFFE>
The spirit looks bored, yawns and then vanishes...<$FFFE>
You smile brightly at the spirit.<$FFFD>
"You're such an adorable person.<$FFFC>
I've decided,<$fe><$3c>I'll let you have this!"<$FFFE>
Ring of Lauren was obtained!<$FFFE>
The spirit looks bored, yawns and then vanishes...<$FFFE>
Suddenly a voice can be heard from somewhere around...<$FFFD>
"Why have you come here?<$FFFC>
Just what on earth do you want?"<$FFFE>
What do you reply?<$FFFE>
I had nothing special in mind<$FFFE>
For some reason or another<$FFFE>
The moment you spoke those words,<$FFFE>
the voice can be heard again.<$FFFD>
"It seems that thinking isn't your forte.<$FFFC>
This should suit you well."<$FFFE>
Devil Axe was obtained!<$FFFE>
A stupid answer like this shall be rewarded with the most audible form of stupidity.<$FFFE>
You try to talk back but can't because you're laughing too intense, holding your abdomen...<$FFFE>
When you inspect the floodgate, a strange object falls off.<$FFFE>
Talisman of the Holy King was obtained!<$FFFE>
The mansion was just before our eyes...<$FFFE>
What did I do wrong!?<$FFFC>
Such pain!<$FFFE>
How shameful.<$FFFC>
After all, I lack knowledge...<$FFFE>
You live by the sword and you...<$FFFE>
It hurts...<$FFFE>
Oh my?<$FFFC>
How could my powers fail me so...<$FFFE>
Too bad...<$FFFC>
I was careless...<$FFFE>
Father!<$FFFE>
Luna...<$FFFE>
Dammit!<$FFFC>
It is time for me to pass on...<$FFFE>
Noo!<$FFFE>
If you hold still it won't hurt that much.<$FFFC>
Take this!<$FFFE>
Unbelievable...<$FFFC>
That was one clever trap, he really is as good as they say.<$FFFE>
Uuu!<$FFFE>
I'll take revenge...one day!<$FFFE>
Lord Torrand!<$FFFE>
Forgive me...<$FFFE>
Help..me...<$FFFE>
Kyaaa!<$FFFE>
So he being called a genius strategist was no exaggeration after all.<$FFFC>
However, this is nothing more than one lost battle of many to come.<$FFFD>
At least tell me the name of the man that thwarted our victory today!<$FFFE>
Larcuss lives on!<$FFFE>
I'm sorry Lord Emaillink...<$FFFE>
Damn!<$FFFC>
How unpleasant...<$FFFE>
What absurdity!<$FFFE>
Uuu!<$FFFE>
Uwaa!<$FFFE>
What senseless death...<$FFFE>
So soon...<$FFFC>
I'm going to were my ancestors are...<$FFFE>
Guaa!<$FFFE>
Th..this is nothing, I can't die like...<$FFFE>
There was so much I wanted to do...<$FFFE>
Uuu...!<$FFFC>
My...vision grows dark...<$FFFE>
Not fair!<$FFFE>
Arrgh!<$FFFE>
Why do I have to die like this!?<$FFFE>
Already, my time has come...<$FFFE>
Ridiculous!<$FFFE>
Uuuarrrgg!<$FFFE>
Long live the Rigüler Empire...<$FFFE>
!?<$FFFC>
The unit I send out to intercept them was crushed!<$FFFC>
Dang, if only I had more time...<$FFFD>
You knight there!<$FFFC>
Surely you are their commander.<$FFFC>
What is your name?<$FFFE>
Crap!<$FFFC>
We didn't expect them to come this way.<$FFFD>
There is no use in hiding anymore.<$FFFC>
It can't be helped, charge at the enemy!<$FFFE>
Yes sir, understood!<$FFFE>
So there was an ambush after all.<$FFFC>
If it weren't for Luna's warning this could have gotten pretty bad.<$FFFE>
Thank you Luna.<$FFFC>
You really saved us.<$FFFE>
Not at all...this was nothing to take note of...
This is the end of your road!<$FFFE>
Hah...<$FFFC>
Prepare to taste the power of one of the four imperial Generals.<$FFFD>
Against my skill there's nothing but defeat for you to gain!<$FFFE>
So our spearmen have been totally destroyed...<$FFFE>
Your only hope for victory is no more, Lord Torrand.<$FFFC>
Your ongoing struggle is in vain.<$FFFD>
Prepare yourself!<$FFFE>
You might be right.<$FFFC>
And yet I won't let down hope until this battle is concluded.<$FFFD>
To my last moment, I will keep on fighting!<$FFFE>
I'm [diehardt's name], Knight of Larcuss.<$FFFE>
I shall memorize that name.<$FFFC>
I'm Emaillink of the four imperial generals.<$FFFD>
For the moment I will retreat.<$FFFC>
However, I've got a feeling that we'll meet on the field of honor again.<$FFFE>
Sir [diehardt's name]...<$FFFC>
This mission took you much longer than it should have...<$FFFE>
I'm sorry...<$FFFC>
By the way, is Baron Torrand safe?<$FFFE>
You did commendable, Sir [diehardt's name].<$FFFE>
Phew, somehow we managed to fend them off.<$FFFC>
But most importantly, is Barron Torrand safe?<$FFFE>
Phew, somehow we managed to fend them off.<$FFFC>
But most importantly, is Barron Torrand safe?<$FFFE>
Father, are you unhurt?<$FFFE>
Father, are you unhurt?<$FFFE>
Yes, Luna.<$FFFC>
There's no need to worry about me.<$FFFC>
But who are those people?<$FFFE>
We are here at the behest of Lord Raymond, who is currently making an effort to restore Larcuss.<$FFFD>
We came to borrow the power of the famous master strategist Torrand for the said cause.<$FFFE>
Oh, lord Raymond you say.<$FFFD>
Your journey must have been long and arduous.<$FFFC>
Tell me all the details after you made yourself at home in my mansion.<$FFFE>
<$FFFF>
