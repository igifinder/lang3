Velzerian Castle ~ Underground<$FFFF>
Show yourself, Paul!<$FFFC>
Return her this moment!<$FFFE>
Hmph! You're already here.<$FFFC>
I thought Geier would be more useful.<$FFFE>
Paul!<$FFFC>
You're only holding a grudge against me, leave the others of out of this!<$FFFC>
Let go of her!<$FFFE>
Now now, don't get so worked up.<$FFFC>
Don't worry, I shall tend to you shortly.<$FFFE>
Once lord Chaos has been revived, I will make sure to bless you with an especially horrible death.<$FFFE>
What a twisted man.<$FFFE>
This is it!<$FFFC>
You make me sick you cowardly bastard!<$FFFE>
We must hurry.<$FFFC>
We don't have the luxury to waste time with him.<$FFFE>
What is that sword?<$FFFC>
Beside Al Hazard, there shouldn't be a sword that powerful in existence!<$FFFE>
Uwaah!<$FFFC>
H..how did he summon all those demons at once!?<$FFFE>
Hahahaha!<$FFFC>
Doesn't it appeal to you?<$FFFC>
My new magnificent power?<$FFFD>
This is the power Lord Chaos bestowed upon me.<$FFFC>
And it will increase even more once Lord Chaos revival is complete!<$FFFE>
I will turn this hopes to ashes.<$FFFC>
Everyone, lend me your strength!<$FFFE>
Have at you, Paul...no, Böser!<$FFFE>
Muhahaha!<$FFFC>
At last, my prayers have reached Lord Chaos!<$FFFE>
What!?<$FFFE>
Eeek!<$FFFC>
...,Nooo!<$FFFE>
Tiaris!<$FFFE>
Ahh...!<$FFFC>
This is no good...<$FFFE>
Riffany!<$FFFE>
...G..Goodbye...<$FFFE>
Luna!<$FFFE>
...Thank you.<$FFFC>
Y..You must defeat Chaos...<$FFFE>
Sophia!<$FFFE>
...Farewell...I'll be waiting..forever...<$FFFE>
Flaire!<$FFFE>
Hahahaha!<$FFFC>
It has been done!<$FFFE>
Lord Chaos revival is finally at hand!<$FFFC>
Ahahahaha!<$FFFE>
...You did well, Böser.<$FFFE>
Yes, my lord!<$FFFC>
I'm your ever loyal servant!<$FFFE>
...We..we couldn't save her...<$FFFE>
I...I...<$FFFE>
We have failed to prevent the revival of Chaos...<$FFFE>
...Böser...Chaos...<$FFFC>
If it wasn't for you, she would still be here with me!<$FFFE>
I swear on my life that I will crush you for what you did!<$FFFE>
-Defeat Paul and Chaos<$FFFE>
-Death of [diehardt's name]<$FFFE>
Stall them to earn some more time for Lord Chaos revival.<$FFFC>
And don't you to fail me!<$FFFE>
KISYAAA!<$FFFE>
Oh I can't wait to welcome lord Chaos to his new domain...<$FFFD>
The ceremony is almost complete.<$FFFE>
Good.<$FFFC>
Now it's only a matter of minutes before lord Chaos rises.<$FFFD>
In the meantime I'll take care of those nuisances.<$FFFE>
<$F704><$F704>Lord Böser, when will lord Chaos arrive?<$FFFE>
Don't be impatient.<$FFFD>
The revival of lord Chaos is close at hand.<$FFFC>
Hahahaha!<$FFFE>
Lord of darkness, god of chaos!<$FFFC>
Hear my calling and manifest into this world!<$FFFE>
The ceremony has advanced quiet a bit...<$FFFE>
Unfortunately,<$FFFC>
the ceremony has approached the final stage.<$FFFE>
This chant...<$FFFC>
I'm afraid the ceremony will be concluded shortly...<$FFFE>
Uoo...Ah...<$FFFE>
Oho!<$FFFC>
The voice of Lord Chaos can be heard!<$FFFD>
Soon.<$FFFC>
Very soon, the ceremony will be complete!<$FFFE>
Uuu...!<$FFFC>
This surge of dark energy...<$FFFE>
Are you alright, Varna?<$FFFD>
Khh, Chaos revival is that close already!?<$FFFE>
Varna...<$FFFC>
How much time do we have before the revival of Chaos?<$FFFE>
I can no longer...<$FFFE>
Iyaaa....,<$FFFC>
not now....<$FFFE>
Aahhh...please hurry....<$FFFC>
there's no time....<$FFFE>
After coming so far.....?<$FFFC>
So...still...<$FFFE>
The level of dark energy around has increased...<$FFFC>
This is awful....<$FFFE>
[diehardt's name]...<$FFFE>
Oh, it seems they are making their way over here!<$FFFC>
All forces to the offensive!<$FFFD>
For the Revival of Chaos nobody must be allowed to pass!<$FFFE>
[diehardt's name]...<$FFFE>
Hold on, Tiaris!<$FFFC>
I'm by your side now!<$FFFE>
[diehardt's name]...<$FFFE>
Hold on, Riffany!<$FFFC>
I'm by your side now!<$FFFE>
Hold on, Luna!<$FFFC>
I'm by your side now!<$FFFE>
[diehardt's name]...<$FFFE>
Hold on, Sophia!<$FFFC>
I'm by your side now!<$FFFE>
[diehardt's name]...<$FFFE>
Hold on, Flaire!<$FFFC>
I'm by your side now!<$FFFE>
[diehardt's name]...<$FFFE>
You won't be forgiven, Böser!<$FFFE>
Who would care for one or two dead humans, what are you getting fired up over?<$FFFE>
Shut up!<$FFFE>
Prepare for your end, I shall now claim her back!<$FFFE>
You think you can kill me!?<$FFFC>
Feel the power of the true Böser!<$FFFE>
So you are Chaos.<$FFFC>
I will cleanse the world of you!<$FFFE>
That life I consumed was delicious it recognizes you!<$FFFE>
Whaat!<$FFFE>
Out of my way!<$FFFC>
Don't waste my time!<$FFFE>
Forgive me Tiaris...<$FFFE>
Forgive me Riffany...<$FFFE>
Forgive me Luna...<$FFFE>
Forgive me Sophia...<$FFFE>
Forgive me Flaire...<$FFFE>
Forgive me, for not being able to stay by your side until the end...<$FFFE>
Please excuse my failings, [diehardt's name].<$FFFC>
It seems like I have to...<$FFFE>
I'm sorry lord [diehardt's name].<$FFFC>
After coming so far.<$FFFE>
C..Crap!<$FFFC>
If only I had more power...<$FFFE>
Forgive me for failing you all.<$FFFE>
I humbly apologize for all my missteps...<$FFFE>
Please protect the human world...<$FFFE>
Don't let them turn it into the demon world...<$FFFC>
Uurrgh!<$FFFE>
Chaos will be here shortly the dark energy surge has amplified massively...<$FFFE>
Lord [diehardt's name]...<$FFFC>
I leave her in your care...<$FFFE>
Lord [diehardt's name]...,<$FFFC>
I entrust her to you...<$FFFE>
Guaaaaa!<$FFFC>
And so my way ends...<$FFFE>
D..Damn...<$FFFC>
Now everything I fought for...<$FFFE>
[diehardt's name],<$FFFC>
please take care of the princess...<$FFFE>
Never mind me, [diehardt's name].<$FFFC>
You aren't allowed to lose no matter what, you hear me!<$FFFE>
Shit!<$FFFC>
What intimidating might...<$FFFE>
Don't let yourself be defeated!<$FFFE>
Ch..Chaos mustn't be revived...no matter what it takes....<$FFFE>
Now kick their bu..urgh..<$FFFC>
Y..You can do it...<$FFFE>
You must rescue her no matter what...<$FFFC>
[diehardt's name] If I fail now...<$FFFE>
...my life has been in vain...<$FFFE>
I..will not permit you...to...<$FFFE>
So this is where my life ends...<$FFFE>
Lord Chaos revival is nigh, now there's nothing left to be feared by us <$FFFC>
and this whole world will be under the supreme rule of the demon family!<$FFFE>
This world is destined to be ruled by lord Chaos and the demon kind!<$FFFE>
Th..that can't..I...<$FFFC>
Is this the consequence of not having Al Hazard by my side?<$FFFE>
But no matter, Lord Chaos will simply revive me...<$FFFE>
Hahaha.<$FFFC>
Lord Chaos...<$FFFC>
It seems I must stand down a while.<$FFFE>
You can rest for now.<$FFFE>
I have only just awoken but once I regain my full strength my powers are limitless.<$FFFE>
At the moment you can give in to death without worry.<$FFFE>
...I'm eternally grateful..to you...<$FFFE>
I see...so it was due to that sword that Lord Chaos was...<$FFFE>
Impossible, humans never would be able to forge a blade like this...<$FFFD>
Only with the assistance of a divine being such as Lord Chaos would it be...<$FFFE>
...It's over.<$FFFE>
Soon this world will be plunged into darkness.<$FFFC>
When that happens..you measly..humans...will..<$FFFD>
Guaah!<$FFFE>
Eeeey!<$FFFC>
Fight on relentlessly!<$FFFD>
If you falter now Lord Chaos revival is in danger!<$FFFE>
GUGA!<$FFFE>
GUGA!<$FFFE>
I'll reserve a place in hell for you...<$FFFE>
GOON!<$FFFE>
GOON!<$FFFE>
Ahhh, back home...<$FFFE>
ZAPP!!<$FFFE>
Hihihi.<$FFFC>
Your face is glowing in bright red...<$FFFE>
So it wasn't in embarrassment...<$FFFE>
ZAPP!!<$FFFE>
Guuaa....<$FFFE>
BUURRR...<$FFFE>
SHHHHAAA...<$FFFE>
BUURRR...<$FFFE>
SHAAAA!<$FFFE>
Aahhh.....!<$FFFE>
For now I leave this pitiable world behind...<$FFFE>
Gyaaaahh!<$FFFE>
I'm...immortal...you'll see...<$FFFE>
They are too strong...<$FFFE>
Darkness take me in...<$FFFE>
BURRRR....<$FFFE>
GOOON!<$FFFE>
GUGA!<$FFFE>
GYAAAAH!<$FFFE>
GYAAAAH!<$FFFE>
GUGA!<$FFFE>
GOOON!<$FFFE>
BURRRR....<$FFFE>
Without me this world would simply stop.<$FFFC>
The force of Chaos is indispensable for this world.<$FFFE>
...So you have the Langrisser with you.<$FFFC>
That sword is such an eyesore.<$FFFE>
This sword will be your certain end.<$FFFC>
Prepare yourself!<$FFFE>
My end, I see...<$FFFC>
Hahaha....<$FFFE>
What is so funny!<$FFFE>
What do you think chaos actually is?<$FFFE>
I and Lushiris are the keepers of a delicate equilibrium in this world.<$FFFE>
The forces of darkness and light raising up against each other are what keeps this world alive.<$FFFE>
And isn't life very much depended on an endless circle of creation and destruction?<$FFFE>
What do you mean...<$FFFC>
Explain yourself...<$FFFE>
Right now you wish for me to be gone.<$FFFC>
However, I'm very much needed for this age to not end in stagnation.<$FFFE>
But, that sword is a danger to this very world.<$FFFC>
If the one wielding it should desire, he could become an even greater destructive force than I am.<$FFFE>
Absurd!<$FFFC>
There couldn't be a more destructive force than the god of destruction himself!<$FFFE>
Chaos has two aspects to it, one is destruction but the other is renewal.<$FFFC>
In other words, the destruction brought by me brings forth new life and keeps the world progressing.<$FFFE>
But that sword is different.<$FFFE>
If one wields it with a corrupted heart, the power of this swords brings nothing but total annihilation.<$FFFC>
The very existence of this sword will stir up greed and lust for power in the human heart.<$FFFE>
Hehehehe...<$FFFC>
For now I shall return to darkness and watch this world from beyond...<$FFFE>
Böser.<$FFFC>
I'm leaving the rest to you.<$FFFE>
Yes, Lord Chaos.<$FFFE>
...Somehow he got me thinking.<$FFFE>
Could Langrisser's existence truly be so dangerous? <$FFFE>
Juuaaa...<$FFFE>
We did it!<$FFFC>
Victory is ours, Chaos!<$FFFE>
...It only seems to you that way right now.<$FFFE>
This age has been in dire need of me.<$FFFE>
What are you saying?<$FFFC>
This age needed you..?<$FFFE>
Yes.<$FFFC>
Order and Chaos are opposite aspects of the same thing.<$FFFE>
You are free to worship light as a symbol of law. But if order becomes absolute progress stops.<$FFFE>
And there is no live in a world where nothing is moving on and nothing new is born.<$FFFC>
Therefore to reset everything to a blank paper the destruction is needed<$FFFE>
The force of the chaotic is needed.<$FFFE>
However, it is up to us humans to choose.<$FFFE>
Only because the renewal of life is needed, won't just lay down and die!<$FFFE>
Certainly.<$FFFC>
But it would do you good to remember.<$FFFE>
The forces of chaos and order are intertwined ineradicable and work through you humans.<$FFFC>
You're own life is proof of it.<$FFFE>
The force of chaos is within every human.<$FFFC>
That is the thing you need to understand the most...<$FFFE>
I shall remember those words!<$FFFE>
There will be humans to seek to revive you!<$FFFC>
But no matter how many times that'll happen, there'll also be humans to seal you as well!<$FFFE>
Your hope may be justified...<$FFFC>
Since this is the factor that keeps the world in a state of delicate equilibrium.<$FFFE>
Farewell.<$FFFC>
You can rest assured that we will not meet again.<$FFFE>
But one day there'll be no man or woman to hold high that noble spirit of yours and that is when I will return...<$FFFE>
...How...that sword stroke me with a surge of energy like there is no other...<$FFFD>
Just what is this sword...?<$FFFE>
This is the Holy Sword Langrisser.<$FFFD>
The King of Elthlied infused it with his own life-force, thus the holy blade Langrisser was born, bearing the power to seal away the powers of you demon kind.<$FFFE>
No matter how many times you'll return to haunt this world you'll never win against those with Langerisser on their side!!<$FFFE>
Langrisser...<$FFFC>
I shall remember that name.<$FFFC>
When I will awake once more, I will get a hold of that sword right away.<$FFFE>
Once this sword is dealt with, Lord Chaos will rule supreme...<$FFFC>
What a joyous occasion it will be.<$FFFE>
...Hahahaha!<$FFFE>
Khh...we have to hurry now...<$FFFE>
The ceremony is almost complete!?<$FFFE>
Um....<$FFFC>
I hope you know what you're doing.<$FFFE>
I do.<$FFFD>
We'll have to concentrate our attacks on Böser himself!<$FFFE>
<$FFFF>
