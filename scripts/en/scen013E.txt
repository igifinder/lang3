Eastern Lushiris Gate<$FFFF>
Come with us quietly!<$FFFC>
If you resist your life is forfeit!<$FFFE>
Do you only know the way of the sword?<$FFFC>
I can't let you walk through this door to erase the holy light.<$FFFE>
Your holy place holds little importance to us!<$FFFE>
Are you even aware of the significance this gate holds?<$FFFE>
This temple is a source of rebellious actions against the Empire.<$FFFC>
This cannot be ignored!<$FFFE>
Now, step aside!<$FFFE>
If there is no other way I will keep you from this place with force.<$FFFE>
Such a stubborn old man!<$FFFE>
Oh my, the imperial soldiers are here already.<$FFFE>
But the gate hasn't fallen.<$FFFC>
As of now the Imperials are still trying to capture it.<$FFFE>
Father...<$FFFE>
Hmm!?<$FFFC>
It appears that some enemy reinforcements have come.<$FFFE>
Hmph.<$FFFC>
Annoying pests.<$FFFC>
Commence the operation we discussed earlier we've discussed earlier.<$FFFE>
Understood!<$FFFE>
Father.<$FFFC>
Please hold out a little longer.<$FFFC>
We will be there to aid you forthwith!<$FFFE>
Everyone, be extremely careful!<$FFFC>
It seems as if they are planning to blow up the bridge.<$FFFD>
Make absolutely sure not to get caught in the explosion!<$FFFE>
Sir [diehardt's name].<$FFFC>
The commander in front of the bridge seems to be in charge.<$FFFD>
If he is defeated we probably will be able to stop the bridge from being destroyed.<$FFFE>
Sir [diehardt's name].<$FFFC>
The enemy strategy has become a matter of concern.<$FFFE>
They seem to be planning to destroy the bridge in front of us.<$FFFE>
Yeah.<$FFFC>
The commander in front of the bridge seems to be in charge.<$FFFD>
If he is defeated we probably will be able to stop the bridge from being destroyed.<$FFFE>
They are planning to blow up the bridge.<$FFFD>
Maybe it is that commander in front of the bridge who is in charge?<$FFFE>
The enemy has started deploying!<$FFFE>
We are facing dragon knights.<$FFFC>
Be careful everyone!<$FFFE>
Alright, blow up this bridge already!<$FFFE>
Yes sir!<$FFFE>
It's getting dangerous!<$FFFC>
Everyone get off the bridge!<$FFFE>
What!?<$FFFD>
To resort to such cowardly methods...<$FFFE>
The thread of the bridge being destroy is no more.<$FFFC>
Now chase away the remaining enemy troops and ensure Fauvel's safety.<$FFFE>
We don't have to worry about the destruction of the bridge anymore.<$FFFC>
Sweep up the remaining enemy troops!<$FFFE>
These fools.<$FFFC>
They grow awfully optimistic, this will be their certain downfall!<$FFFD>
Hurry up and finish this operation!<$FFFE>
Yes sir!<$FFFE>
You there, get that geezer out of the way already!<$FFFE>
Leave him to me!<$FFFE>
Pin down the enemy!<$FFFC>
Buy us as much time as possible!<$FFFE>
Yes sir!<$FFFC>
Charge at the enemy and halt their advance!<$FFFE>
Understood, we'll stop them where they stand!<$FFFC>
Charge!<$FFFE>
Let's see if those guys can to do battle in mid air!<$FFFE>
Soon!<$FFFE>
So very soon!<$FFFE>
Just a tiny little bit longer!<$FFFE>
The preparations for destroying the bridge were completed!<$FFFD>
Please give the order!<$FFFE>
The preparations for destroying the bridge were completed!<$FFFD>
Please give the order!<$FFFE>
Muhahaha...!<$FFFC>
You did well, for a change! <$FFFC>
This will annihilate those pests!<$FFFE>
The cavalry unit has yet to arrive, but you will find me plenty enemy to deal with!<$FFFD>
Come at me with everything you have to offer, [diehardt's name]!<$FFFC>
Forward!<$FFFE>
Yes sir!<$FFFE>
So the flying unit's have suffered major damage...<$FFFC>
True strength, comes from the heart, [diehardt's name]!<$FFFE>
Father!<$FFFC>
Are you unharmed?<$FFFE>
Oho, if it isn't my Sophia?<$FFFC>
Forgive me for causing you to worry soo...<$FFFE>
For now, please come this way.<$FFFE>
Oho, you come to a most favorable time.<$FFFE>
For now come this way!<$FFFE>
Thank you...<$FFFE>
They are approaching!<$FFFC>
Move out and intercept them!<$FFFE>
Yessir!<$FFFC>
Charge at the enemy!<$FFFE>
Understood.<$FFFC>
We will back you up!<$FFFE>
Surrounded by stones there is an altar, in which some ragged clothes have been enshrined.<$FFFE>
Do you want to reach out for the clothes?<$FFFE>
The moment you grasp them, the ragged clothes turn into a suit of splendid fabric!<$FFFE>
Black Suit was obtained!<$FFFE>
Curses!<$FFFE>
It hurts...<$FFFE>
Uwaaa...!<$FFFE>
So this is where it ends...<$FFFE>
I have to take my leave...<$FFFE>
Ahh..I cannot move...<$FFFE>
Sir [diehardt's name]...<$FFFE>
Ahh...<$FFFE>
Lushiris...my goddess...<$FFFC>
Take in your humble servant who has served you to the last breath...<$FFFE>
Father!<$FFFE>
Oh Sophia...<$FFFC>
Forgive me...<$FFFC>
I have been careless...<$FFFE>
Curses!<$FFFC>
We didn't make it in time...<$FFFE>
Damn...<$FFFC>
Still some way to go!<$FFFE>
Father...<$FFFE>
Sophia...<$FFFE>
What do you want to say?<$FFFE>
We have to hurry!<$FFFE>
He will be alright.<$FFFE>
It looks grim...<$FFFE>
Hury up!<$FFFC>
A priest is at a disadvantage against usual troops, he probably won't last long.<$FFFE>
That's true.<$FFFE>
He will be fine.<$FFFC>
Undoubtedly we will save him.<$FFFE>
...Yes!<$FFFE>
It looks grim...<$FFFC>
I wonder if we will be in time?<$FFFE>
....<$FFFE>
Da..Damn...<$FFFC>
To die in place like this...<$FFFD>
I'll be waiting for you in the netherworld!<$FFFE>
What a relief.<$FFFC>
It seems like the destruction of the bridge has been prevented.<$FFFE>
Please father, be patient a little while longer.<$FFFE>
Just hold out!<$FFFC>
We are on our way to help you!<$FFFE>
-Defeat all enemies<$FFFE>
-Death of Diehärte [diehardt's name]<$FFFC>
-Death of Fauvel<$FFFE>
Tsk, they plan to disturb our strategy!?<$FFFE>
Hahaha...!<$FFFC>
I'll kill everyone who tries that personally!<$FFFE>
Guaaaa!<$FFFE>
This is your last chance, come with us quietly!<$FFFE>
That I cannot do,<$FFFC>
for I have dedicated my life to protect this holy site.<$FFFE>
W..Why...<$FFFE>
Khe!<$FFFC>
What a pain!<$FFFE>
Urgg!<$FFFE>
Guuaaa!<$FFFE>
Not..yet..<$FFFE>
Defeat tastes oh so bitter...<$FFFE>
Guuurg!<$FFFE>
The blood won't stop flowing...<$FFFE>
Hey!<$FFFC>
Do something useful!<$FFFD>
Do me a favor and hurry up blowing up that bridge already.<$FFFC>
We can't hold back their advance much longer!<$FFFE>
Yessir!<$FFFE>
Heey!<$FFFC>
You worthless maggots!<$FFFD>
Since you all are so incompetent I'll take on those Larcuss survivors myself!<$FFFE>
Kyaaaa!<$FFFE>
Is there no higher purpose in life?<$FFFE>
Well, I was defeated again...<$FFFC>
But that is fine.<$FFFC>
This place holds no strategic value.<$FFFD>
And in the long run there the Empire will conquer everything.<$FFFE>
Hold it!<$FFFC>
Emaillink!<$FFFE>
Farewell, [diehardt's name]!<$FFFC>
I'm looking forward to our next encounter!<$FFFE>
Crossing swords with you was a great enjoyment!<$FFFD>
But for now I must take my leave!<$FFFE>
I wouldn't have expected anything less of you!<$FFFE>
It is unfortunate but you must die!<$FFFE>
I raised my arm with full force!<$FFFC>
But still..still, stiill!<$FFFE>
Forgive me, General Emaillink...<$FFFE>
How could you do...!<$FFFE>
How could I've been defeated!?<$FFFE>
Such...might...<$FFFE>
So that's my limit...<$FFFE>
Oh!<$FFFC>
By the grace of the goddess the attack stopped!<$FFFE>
Take a rest for now.<$FFFC>
Please leave the remaining fighting to us, father.<$FFFE>
Take a rest for now.<$FFFC>
Please leave the remaining fighting to us, Fauvel.<$FFFE>
Thank you.<$FFFC>
I'm greatly indebted to all of you.<$FFFE>
...It's over.<$FFFE>
Your commanding was beautiful, Sir [diehardt's name].<$FFFE>
Sir [diehardt's name]...<$FFFC>
WE took way to long for this mission...<$FFFD>
This will have negative effects on the next mission...<$FFFE>
Heyyy!<$FFFC>
Be of some use once in a lifetime!<$FFFD>
Hold them of just a little bit longer!<$FFFE>
Do I have to do everything myself?<$FFFC>
Sir [diehardt's name].<$FFFE>
What is it?<$FFFC>
If the bridge is destroyed it will be hard to help Fauvel.<$FFFC>
Hurry up, strike down that commander!<$FFFE>
Curses!<$FFFC>
How did they manage to grow even stronger...<$FFFE>
General Emaillink we will protect you with our very lifes.<$FFFC>
General, please withdraw for now!<$FFFD>
General, you mustn't throw your life away...<$FFFE>
I'm sorry...<$FFFC>
You are in command for now.<$FFFE>
Please leave everything to us!<$FFFE>
I've been looking for you, [diehardt's name]!<$FFFE>
Not you again, Emaillink!<$FFFE>
Now I will demonstrate the power of the Rigüler cavalry division!<$FFFE>
Excuse us for being late General Emaillink.<$FFFE>
Don't worry about it.<$FFFC>
Move out and attack the enemy from the back.<$FFFC>
But don't overdo it you have to be exhausted after climbing that teep mountains.<$FFFE>
No sir, we are as fresh as the morning dew.<$FFFE>
Hah, I see in that case I'm counting on you.<$FFFE>
Hm, you bested General Emaillink!?<$FFFC>
Receive your due punishment!<$FFFE>
<$FFFF>
