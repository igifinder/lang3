So the citizens managed to get away, thanks to what was his name again, [diehardt's name]?<$FFFE>
My humble apologies.<$FFFE>
This lot certainly made quiet a fool out of you.<$FFFC>
Your pity is not only wasted but also allowed them to escape.<$FFFD>
And don't think looking at me with puppy eyes will make up for this.<$FFFC>
Bah, I've got enough of this place.<$FFFD>
I'm returning to the royal castle.<$FFFC>
In the meantime you'll be in command, consider it a chance.<$FFFD>
Oh before I forget, the appropriate tax rate will be doubled!<$FFFE>
Doubled!?<$FFFC>
But this will rob the townspeople of their livelihood!<$FFFD>
No this will lead to revolt....<$FFFE>
Suits me just fine!<$FFFD>
When it comes to it they shall feel our blades!<$FFFC>
Those who dare to defy me will be shown no mercy.<$FFFE>
.....<$FFFE>
I think we're done here.<$FFFE>
General Dios .....<$FFFE>
Nowadays, I am asking myself if following the King's orders is the right thing to do.<$FFFE>
Impossible, you couldn't be thinking of desertion?<$FFFD>
It's a crime punished with death!<$FFFC>
Surely the King would send pursuers after you.<$FFFE>
So what if? Do you think I could be sniffed out by some common soldiers?<$FFFC>
You should know that I am not that weak.<$FFFE>
Even if you could escape, do you honestly want to leave your family and home country behind, please reconsider...<$FFFE>
You're right.<$FFFD>
If it would be just me I'd do it, but I can't let my wife and children walk the plank as well.<$FFFD>
This is bad.<$FFFC>
Something strange is going on here but I don't know what just yet.<$FFFC>
For now consider it a joke.<$FFFE>
Okay.<$FFFC>
As long as only I know about how you feel.<$FFFD>
I have to return to my duty and convey messages for the King.<$FFFE>
King Wilder is going mad....<$FFFC>
I hate this! Just what is he up to? <$FFFE>
Desertion means Death.....Damn it all!<$FFFE>
Viscount Raymond' Mansion<$FFFF>
The Royal capital Larcussia has fallen victim to the invasion of the imperial forces.<$FFFC>
...This all happened because we let our troops growing weak and idle.<$FFFD>
We got too used to peace and neglected to protect it.<$FFFE>
Yes, Father.<$FFFE>
Lord Raymond!<$FFFC>
Some guests have just arrived.<$FFFE>
Visitors?<$FFFC>
Tell me who they might be.<$FFFE>
Yes, sir!<$FFFC>
It seems to be the young Sir Klaus in company of some others.<$FFFE>
Oh, [diehardt's name].<$FFFC>
Let them enter forthwith.<$FFFE>
Yessir!<$FFFE>
Lord Raymond. <$FFFC>
It has been a long time.<$FFFE>
Indeed far too long, [diehardt's name]!<$FFFE>
At last I stand before you as a knight. <$FFFE>
So from now on I shall call you Lord [diehardt's name].<$FFFC>
Please just call me [diehardt's name] as before.<$FFFE>
Well, so you are a knight now.<$FFFD>
Hmm?<$FFFC>
Tell me how you became one...<$FFFE>
Yes, in the floating castle above the royal capitol of Larcussia, where Duke William reigned, I absolved my training.<$FFFE>
I'm glad that you escaped from the catastrophe that befell the castle.<$FFFD>
Do you know of anything to report from Larcussia concerning the invasion of the Rigüler Empire?<$FFFE>
Yessir, we witnessed the invasion wit our own eyes.<$FFFC>
It was the Imperial Field Marshal Altemüller that lead the assault himself.<$FFFD>
In spite of fighting back bravely, Duke William fell during the attack.<$FFFE>
So even with his masterly swordsmanship....<$FFFE>
.....<$FFFE>
Oh, this is the dukes only daughter Tiaris.<$FFFD>
And this is Miss Layla.<$FFFE>
It is an honor to make your acquaintance Viscount Raymond.<$FFFE>
She was Geriord's fiancée....<$FFFE>
I see.<$FFFC>
Please excuse me for bringing up such painful matters......<$FFFE>
...It's alright, Viscount.<$FFFE>
I won't give in to sorrow just yet. <$FFFD>
Even now we can't be certain that Geriord is dead....<$FFFE>
So tell me, was Geriord injured during that battle as well?<$FFFE>
Yes.<$FFFC>
It happened when he and Altemüller engaged in a fierce duel...<$FFFE>
So that is how.<$FFFD>
Imperial Field Marshal Altemüller.<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
What a man....<$FFFE>
Lord William.<$FFFC>
Our next step should be to recruit soldiers and prepare to reclaim Larcussia.<$FFFE>
I agree.<$FFFE>
But first of all we will resort to the army of our allies the Barral Kingdom.<$FFFE>
!!<$FFFC>
That would be hopeless!<$FFFC>
As for Barrel.....,<$FFFC>
they....<$FFFE>
......<$FFFE>
What is the matter?<$FFFE>
If I may explain. We escaped from Larcussia and headed to the city of Laffel.<$FFFE>
Shortly after the town was attacked and occupied by the Barral Kingdom's troops.<$FFFC>
.....Ohh, Geriord.<$FFFE>
What staggering blow...<$FFFE>
King Wilder used to be such a kind man, so why would he......<$FFFE>
Ah yes, the Klaus family and the Barral royal family used to be close to another.<$FFFE>
Yes.<$FFFC>
Princess Flaire and I are childhood friends.....<$FFFE>
...Well, it can't be helped.<$FFFC>
Shortly I will assemble my commanders and plan our next steps.<$FFFE>
But you seem to be worn out.<$FFFC>
For now please take your time and recover from the ordeals you've been through.<$FFFE>
<$FFFF>
