Scenario ~ 19<$FFFC>
"A man called Bortz"<$FFFE>
After the destruction of the Galshook, General Bortz gathered his<$FFFC>
remaining troops and began a retreat, to prevent the complete<$FFFC>
annihilation of his men. This is just like Bortz, to accept even<$FFFC>
defeat with manly stoicism and move on.<$FFFE>
However, [diehardt's name]'s mobile division refuses to allow<$FFFC>
him this chance to escape.  As soon as they have reformed<$FFFC>
their troops, they continue their pursuit.<$FFFE>
*Condition for Victory<$FFFC>
 -Defeat of Bortz<$FFFC>
*Conditions for Defeat<$FFFC>
 -Death of [diehardt's name]<$FFFC>
 -Bortz's arrival at the airship<$FFFE>
Boarding Pad for the airship, Near the Larcussia Border Defense Base<$FFFF>
..<$fe><$28>..<$fe><$f>..<$fe><$f>。<$FFFC>
So, there are still some who haven't made their escape.<$FFFE>
That bunch will probably catch up with us soon.<$FFFC>
Somehow, we've got to buy more time.<$FFFE>
...But, what strategy can I come up with.<$FFFE>
Only one pattern comes to mind.<$FFFE>
Never mind them, General.<$FFFE>
All of us would follow you anywhere, General Bortz, even into Hell!<$FFFE>
Us, too!  Please feel free to make whatever use of us you need!<$FFFE>
Heck, I owe my life to the General anyways.<$FFFC>
Now's the perfect time for us to return the favor.<$FFFE>
Please, leave this to us.<$FFFC>
You should hurry up and escape, General.<$FFFE>
You guys......<$FFFC>
I've sure got some good guys working under me.<$FFFE>
But, we're all getting out of here together this time.<$FFFE>
General Bortz....<$FFFE>
We'll all do our damnedest to occupy them so our other soldiers can escape.<$FFFC>
We'll be the last ones to board the ship.<$FFFE>
.....After all, you guys have all become like sons to me.<$FFFC>
Just be sure not to become war orphans like me.<$FFFE>
Hold on, General!<$FFFC>
Don't say things like that!<$FFFE>
Sorry about that.<$FFFC>
Alright, now listen up, every one of you damned well better live to return from this!<$FFFE>
Yeahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!<$FFFE>
