Plains of Former Larcuss<$FFFF>
This is the remnants of the Larcuss army?<$FFFC>
Impossible, how can they be this strong....<$FFFE>
Onward!<$FFFC>
Press onward!<$FFFE>
For the restoration of our country!<$FFFE>
Former Larcuss Royal Castle - Currently Imperial Headquarters<$FFFF>
With this, Larcuss is virtually ours!<$FFFE>
We've succeeded faster than I thought possible.<$FFFE>
According to reports I've received, the ruler of a frontier land, Lord Raymond, has raised an army and is striking at the Colcian army.<$FFFE>
....Such talk is worrisome.<$FFFC>
For now, continue observation of the Colcian army and the remnants of the Larcuss army.<$FFFE>
But, with Your Excellency's might, it would be easy to crush these remnants of the Larcuss army.<$FFFE>
That's still no excuse for negligence, General Bortz.<$FFFE>
I fear I have something to bring to your attention!<$FFFD>
10 of the prisoners have managed to escape.<$FFFE>
I'd like to look into this myself.<$FFFD>
This place has grown a mite bit boring.<$FFFC>
I'd like to do something enjoyable like a hunt.<$FFFE>
Geier.<$FFFC>
Don't waste troops for no reason.<$FFFD>
Your tactics often result in heavy casualties.<$FFFE>
................<$FFFE>
...Hunting humans, he said.<$FFFE>
That's just the way he likes to talk about things.<$FFFD>
Well, do as you've said.<$FFFC>
If you fulfill your duty, no questions will be asked.<$FFFD>
Until we receive orders from our homeland, though, it would be best to keep the number of executions to a minimum.<$FFFD>
But, we already know the relative strength of those we've made prisoners.
If, say, they did escape, it wouldn't matter all that much in the long run.<$FFFE>
Hmmph!<$FFFC>
Damn that Altemüller!<$FFFC>
Even if he's said to be the son of the previous emperor, he's too young to be the Field Marshal!<$FFFE>
I've had more combat experience and accomplishments, yet he mouths off at me like that!<$FFFE>
But, I'll show him.<$FFFC>
Sometime soon I'll get a chance to rub his face in the dirt!<$FFFE>
That would be most excellent.<$FFFD>
That brat doesn't have a chance in the world against you, General.<$FFFE>
Damn straight.<$FFFD>
Let's go, Gates!<$FFFE>
Yessir!<$FFFE>
