Several weeks after Alhazard was sealed by [diehardt's name] and company...<$FFFE>
Limbus ~ Between the Realms of the Living and the Dead<$FFFF>
Uuuuh, where am I?<$FFFC>
I can't see anything.<$FFFC>
My body, won't move.<$FFFE>
It was him! This is all because of him!<$FFFC>
How I despise him!<$FFFE>
More than any word could express I despise him!<$FFFC>
And with him this whole disgusting world!<$FFFE>
Paul...<$FFFC>
　<$fe><$82>　<$fe><$82>　<$fe><$82>　<$fe><$82>　<$fe><$82>　<$FFFC>
Paul...<$FFFE>
Who is it, calling out to me?<$FFFE>
My name is Chaos.<$FFFC>
I am the deity that governs disorder and renewal.<$FFFE>
Isn't your hate for Altemüller what hinders you to pass on?<$FFFC>
Is it not your foremost desire to exact revenge on Altemüller?<$FFFE>
Re..venge..!<$FFFC>
...Yes. I'll make him pay!<$FFFC>
Not only did he steal the Empire from me, but also the freedom of my body.<$FFFE>
At the very thought of him, a sharp pain runs through my body screaming for retribution!<$FFFE>
Look at you, you can't even walk.<$FFFC>
But he who fell ones mustn't stay helpless.<$FFFE>
...Power...,<$FFFC>
There isn't a being not craving for it,<$FFFC>
do you want power?<$FFFE>
Po..we.r..<$FFFC>
I want the power to tear him apart!<$FFFC>
I want the power to make every living being in existence crawl before me!<$FFFE>
I see. Such anger, such unrestrained will to dominate.<$FFFC>
You are much more suitable to become Böser than Altemüller.<$FFFE>
Only if certain conditions are met, can I enter this world.<$FFFE>
You will take the necessary steps to prepare my arrival.<$FFFE>
Paul.<$FFFC>
I will grant you a portion of my own power!<$FFFC>
Thus your life will last eternally!<$FFFE>
Yeees!<$FFFC>
My Lord Chaos!<$FFFE>
Worship me!<$FFFC>
Praise me!<$FFFC>
Henceforth your name shall be Böser!<$FFFE>
As my lord wishes!<$FFFC>
My body is overflowing with power!<$FFFE>
Magnificent...<$FFFC>
Such limitless power...<$FFFE>
Use this one as your subordinate!<$FFFC>
Envelope this world in the deepest darkness and herald my ascension!<$FFFE>
Yes my lord!<$FFFE>
Velzerian Castle<$FFFF>
...Magnificent,<$FFFE>
More and more power is rising up in me!<$FFFC>
My body almost feels like it's bursting!<$FFFE>
Lord Böser.<$FFFC>
Please give me commands.<$FFFE>
Initially we have to make a sacrifice to Lord Chaos in order to replenish his power.<$FFFE>
In that case, I will bring to you a suitable sacrifice at once.<$FFFE>
I leave it in your hands Demon General Geier!<$FFFE>
Elthlied Royal Castle<$FFFF>
Well, everyone.<$FFFC>
Let us enjoy ourselves tonight.<$FFFE>
The Rigüler Empire,<$FFFC>
the Barral Kingdom,<$FFFC>
and the Kingdom of Elthlied have been restored; let us raise our glasses in celebration, cheers!<$FFFE>
Yahuu!<$FFFC>
Cheers!<$FFFE>
I'm so glad everything worked out.<$FFFE>
Not only did the war end, but the relations between the three kingdoms are better than ever also.<$FFFE>
It most certainly seems that way.<$FFFE>
At last order has been established again.<$FFFE>
Yes.<$FFFC>
We have to thank your many efforts for that.<$FFFE>
Nah, that's not true.<$FFFC>
It was mainly the cooperation of the three countries that made it possible.<$FFFE>
I just hope that peace will remain and war never breaks out again.<$FFFE>
Ha, that's true.<$FFFC>
But if it wasn't for the war we may never have come this far.<$FFFE>
...What irony.<$FFFE>
Kyaa!<$FFFE>
Oh my, Aaahh...!<$FFFC>
Iaaaa!<$FFFE>
Kyaa!<$FFFE>
Aaaiii!<$FFFE>
Kyaah!<$FFFE>
What's happening!?<$FFFE>
Tiaris!<$FFFE>
Riffany!<$FFFE>
Luna!<$FFFE>
Sophia!<$FFFE>
Flaire!<$FFFE>
Hold it right there!<$FFFC>
...Geier you bastard!<$FFFE>
Hahaha!<$FFFC>
This woman shall be the sacrificed to revive lord chaos!<$FFFE>
You, but how...?<$FFFE>
Hehehe, if it isn't Varna.<$FFFC>
Weren't you revived by the exact same dark magic?<$FFFE>
Join us Varna.<$FFFC>
If lord chaos grows weak your body will crumble to dust that moment!<$FFFE>
Leave behind that sorry excuse Altemüller and come to Paul's side!<$FFFE>
May lord Chaos rise again!<$FFFC>
Muahahaha!<$FFFE>
Hold it!<$FFFC>
Let go of her!<$FFFE>
Damn!<$FFFC>
Damn this!<$FFFC>
How could this happen!?<$FFFE>
Varna, what was this all about?<$FFFC>
An explanation would be appropriate.<$FFFE>
Yes.<$FFFC>
Somehow it seems that Paul and Geier were revived by the demon's god chaos.<$FFFE>
Therefore we can assume that Paul has become the next Böser...<$FFFE>
What?<$FFFC>
Paul became Böser...<$FFFE>
Paul now Böser must have ordered to sacrifice her to revive chaos.<$FFFE>
We have not a minute to waste.<$FFFE>
...Even if I must go by myself.<$FFFC>
I have to rescue her!<$FFFE>
We must make haste!<$FFFC>
Time is of the essence!<$FFFE>
I'm in!<$FFFE>
I'll lend you my blade too.<$FFFE>
The one who dared to blow this party, soon only will be a rubble of ashes!<$FFFE>
Altemüller.<$FFFC>
Let us offer our assistance too.<$FFFE>
..But if we stop Böser and prevent the revival of chaos...,<$FFFC>
you could lose your life.<$FFFE>
...Altemüller...<$FFFE>
Please do not worry about me.<$FFFC>
I have died already.<$FFFC>
That I live now already goes against the providence of nature.<$FFFE>
Moreover, we cannot simply leave her to her fate<$FFFC>
and allow chaos to set foot in our world!<$FFFE>
Hm...<$FFFE>
We shall lend to you our power as well.<$FFFC>
We cannot leave her alone nor can the revival of Chaos be tolerated.<$FFFE>
...Thank you, everyone...<$FFFE>
The only place that applies for the ceremony is the Velzerian castle.<$FFFE>
Alright!<$FFFC>
Move out to Velezeria castle!<$FFFE>
　<$FFFC>
Scenario ~ 35<$FFFC>
"The True Enemy"<$FFFE>
At the hands of the demonic deity Chaos, <$FFFC>
Paul arises from the dead as the new Böser.<$FFFC>
To serve as a ceremonial sacrifice for the revival of Chaos, <$FFFC>
Diehärte's beloved is abducted by Demon General Geier.<$FFFE>
Having its lines bolstered up by<$FFFC>
Altemüller and Varna, the division sets out one more time<$FFFC>
towards the Velzerian Castle,<$FFFC>
to prevent the revival of the God of Chaos<$FFFC>
and to rescue the abducted dearest...<$FFFE>
*Condition for Victory<$FFFC>
 -Defeat of Demon General Geier<$FFFC>
*Condition for Defeat<$FFFC>
 -Death of [diehardt's name]<$FFFE>
