persuade Flaire fails.<$FFFC>
The same loses her life in<$FFFC>
the ongoing meaningless battle.<$FFFE>

Varna's Grave ~ Near the Velzerian Castle<$FFFF>
...Varna.<$FFFC>
The one responsible for your death paid the ultimate price,<$FFFC>
as did the murderer of my father.<$FFFD>
Now the Rigüler Empire and Velzeria are my hands.<$FFFC>
Even so....<$FFFE>
This sword seems to grow in power with every further battle.<$FFFE>
Yes, it was created to be this way to accustom the wielder to its power gradually.<$FFFE>
Lord Altemüller....no, you are my lord Böser now.<$FFFE>
Böser?<$FFFE>
Yes.<$FFFC>
Being Böser the ruler over Velzeria, is the destiny of the wielder of Alhazard.<$FFFE>
The prince of darkness.<$FFFC>
So, lastly I became Böser myself.<$FFFE>
With Alhazard you wield powers greater than any other, nothing is impossible for you now.<$FFFE>
...If that is the case, let me try this.<$FFFE>
Huh!<$FFFE>
...Altemüller...<$FFFE>
T..that can't be!<$FFFE>
So Alhazard can even return the dead to the living.<$FFFE>
This magnificent power is yours to command.<$FFFC>
Lord Böser.<$FFFE>
But summoning the undead like this...<$FFFE>
She is not undead.<$FFFC>
With Böser's powers flesh can be constructed anew to be a vessel for the soul.<$FFFD>
She is completely different from the mindless zombies Grove uses.<$FFFD>
This woman is truly alive once more.<$FFFC>
Even though binded to the dark magic. Should it fade the flesh will eventually fall back into ruin.<$FFFE>
...Hmph.<$FFFC>
Evidently this is a godlike power.<$FFFE>
I have fully become that women, Varna and right now I'm bursting with sense of pleasure.<$FFFE>
Let us join in this happiness you made possible.<$FFFE>
Ah...<$FFFE>
...Varna.<$FFFC>
I'm so glad to have you back...<$FFFC>
To be able to meet with you once again...<$FFFE>
Altemüller...<$FFFE>
As the new Böser there won't be anything left for you to desire,<$FFFC>
and Alhazard's powers shall never fail you.<$FFFE>
Now I truly realize.<$FFFC>
With Alhazard's Power there is no end to my possibilities.<$FFFE>
The Empire and Velzeria are already in my hands.<$FFFC>
Wouldn't Elthlead be a suitable next trophy to claim?<$FFFC>
HahaWahahah!<$FFFE>
Lord Altemüller...you have changed...<$FFFE>
<$FFFF>
