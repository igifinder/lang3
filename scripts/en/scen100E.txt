Scenario ~ 30<$FFFC>
"Behind the Mask"<$FFFE>
Although Böser was defeated successfully, the sealing of Alhazard was not completed.<$FFFC>
At Varna's death, Altemüller takes away Alhazard in a rage of fury<$FFFC>
to exact his revenge on the Rigüler Empire.<$FFFC>
As the chase after Altemüller is about to commence,<$FFFE>
a report of an attack from the Barral Kingdom comes in.<$FFFE>
Being startled by the unfolding events, Diehärte decides that protecting the citizens of Neref is a more urgent matter at hand.<$FFFE>
*Conditions of Victory<$FFFC>
 -Defeat all enemies<$FFFC>
*Conditions of Defeat<$FFFC>
 -Death of Diehärte<$FFFC>

Rigüler Castle ~ Audience Hall<$FFFF>
How!<$FFFC>
Can this really be true!?<$FFFE>
It is.<$FFFC>
Although it is rather strange, since I had not few men searching for him...<$FFFD>
In his condition he shouldn't have come far.<$FFFE>
It is quiet unusual for you to fail me so, Field Marshal Geier.<$FFFE>
You may want to consider that Altemüller has allied with the Demons of Velzeria.<$FFFE>
What!?<$FFFC>
He conspires with demons?<$FFFC>
This makes him an open enemy to the Empire!<$FFFD>
Field Marshal Geier I hereby order you formally!<$FFFC>
Obliterate the traitor Altemüller!<$FFFD>
This shall be his punishment for befriending demons and betraying the empire!<$FFFE>
As you wish.<$FFFD>
By all means, I will present his head to you my majesty!<$FFFE>
<$FFFF>
