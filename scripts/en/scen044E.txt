The Rigüler field marshal Altemüller assaults Larcussia<$FFFC>
resulting in the downfall of the once majestic castle.<$FFFC>
[diehardt's name] and his companions only barely make their escape.<$FFFC>
Still in shock of the tragedy they reach the city of Laffel.<$FFFE>
Now their only hope for striking back at the Empire<$FFFC>
is to contact Larcuss's ally, the nearby Barral Kingdom.<$FFFC>
However, short was the time for such thoughts,<$FFFC>
since the flames of war were about to engulf Laffel as well,<$FFFC>
sparkled by someone no one had suspected....<$FFFE>

High Priest.<$FFFC>
Thank you so very much.<$FFFE>
High Priest.<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
Will Geriord be able to recover from his injury?<$FFFE>
...That which lies in my power I have done for him.<$FFFD>
Truthfully speaking it is a miracle that he is alive, even now he is still in a critical state.<$FFFE>
Then....<$FFFE>
In a few days we will know what is to become of him.<$FFFE>
I see...<$FFFE>
Emergency!<$FFFE>
It is the enemy! The enemy is here!<$FFFC>
All citizens must evacuate the city immediately!<$FFFE>
How terrible!<$FFFC>
Out of my way!<$FFFE>
The enemy has come here!?<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
The Empire has caught to up to us fast....<$FFFE>
We have an emergency!<$FFFC>
Enemy troops are threatening to invade Laffel!<$FFFE>
Oh no!<$FFFE>
We must hurry to make preparations for leaving here as soon as possible!<$FFFE>
Yes!<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
Tiaris we must do our part too!<$FFFE>
...Okay...<$FFFC>
[diehardt's name], please hurry too.<$FFFE>
...Wait, [diehardt's name].<$FFFE>
Geriord!?<$FFFC>
How are you feeling?<$FFFE>
So the enemy has come here already?<$FFFE>
Yeah.<$FFFE>
You have to leave me behind and get away from here....<$FFFE>
What are you saying Geriord!<$FFFE>
I know my own body best.<$FFFC>
This injury won't heal any time soon.....<$FFFE>
I couldn't bear to be a burden to all of you.<$FFFC>
That's why you must go without me.<$FFFE>
Right now the Larcussian army has to fall back and reorganize.<$FFFE>
But Geriord!<$FFFE>
[diehardt's name]...,<$FFFC>
you are a knight now.<$FFFC>
Become a splendid one and protect this great land and its people.<$FFFE>
This would be the greatest honor you can bestow upon me.<$FFFC>
One day you'll return here,<$FFFC>
and this is when Laffel will be liberated.<$FFFE>
.....I got it, Geriord.<$FFFC>
I'll become a fine knight and to come back here when that time has arrived, I promise.<$FFFE>
We will form an army and come back here for sure.<$FFFC>
And after we claim back Layla's and your home town, we'll liberate Larcussia as well.<$FFFE>
......Layla my betrothed, please come over here.<$FFFE>
Layla!?<$FFFE>
.....<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
Will you please listen to me?<$FFFE>
Geriord, I....<$FFFE>
...Layla I must ask something of you.<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
You almost became the wife of a knight.<$FFFD>
As such you must be ready to let go always...<$FFFD>
This is my last request.<$FFFC>
You must live and escape with [diehardt's name].<$FFFE>
...I'll do as you say.<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
...However, I will pray for your recovery,<$FFFD>
so you may live to meet with me again....<$FFFE>
Yeah....<$FFFE>
.....<$FFFE>
Cough*....<$FFFC>
Go now, there is no time to lose.<$FFFE>
I entrust this one to you, [diehardt's name]....<$FFFE>
