Scenario ~ 08<$FFFC>
"The Southern Lushiris Gate"<$FFFE>
In times long past, Lushiris Gate was built in order to guard<$FFFC>
against demonic invasion. Gates were built in all four<$FFFC>
directions to complement the power of the Gate.<$FFFE>
At the time when war broke out, it seems that its functionality<$FFFC>
was interrupted; the seal binding the demons is growing<$FFFC>
increasingly weaker.<$FFFE>
The moment when the protection of Lushiris was needed,<$FFFC>
to avert the coming demonic offensive, was quickly<$FFFC>
approaching. Therefore, the party has traveled to the southern gate<$FFFC>
in order to meet its warden, Sophia.<$FFFE>
But enemies are also seeking her and have made preparations<$FFFC>
against the arrival of [diehardt's name] and company.<$FFFE>
*Condition for Victory<$FFFC>
 -Defeat of Do Kahni<$FFFC>
