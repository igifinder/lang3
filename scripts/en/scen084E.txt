Scenario ~ 22<$FFFC>
"To a New Battle"<$FFFE>
About one year after Viscount Raymond mustered troops,<$FFFC>
[diehardt's name] and company liberated the royal capitol.<$FFFC>
After that, Raymond became King Sieghart, ruler of the<$FFFC>
new country, Elthlied.<$FFFE>
Since the time Field Marshal Altemüller had to withdraw<$FFFC>
his troops due to a shortage of supplies, he has steadily<$FFFC>
made preparations for the recapture of Larcuss.<$FFFE>
In contrast, the Elthlied army's first move has been to use<$FFFC>
the speed and power of the mobile attack force to capture<$FFFC>
an Imperial base along the national border.<$FFFE>
*Condition for Victory<$FFFC>
 -Destruction of all enemies<$FFFC>
*Condition for Defeat<$FFFC>
 -Death of [diehardt's name]<$FFFE>
Imperial Base along the Rigüler ~ Elthlied National Border<$FFFF>
Your Excellency Altemüller.<$FFFC>
The attack preparations have been completed.<$FFFE>
Good work.<$FFFC>
Mustering new troops took longer than I had expected.<$FFFD>
Now, the army of Larcuss.....no,<$FFFC>
Elthlied, has likely been bolstered as well.<$FFFE>
It looks like it won't be an easy war to win.<$FFFE>
Easy victories are hollow ones.<$FFFC>
This should be the perfect challenge.<$FFFD>
Emaillink, look after things in my absence!<$FFFE>
Yes, sir, just leave everything else to me!<$FFFC>
Your Excellency should only need to concentrate on the fighting with Elthlied.<$FFFE>
Geier's aerial fortress should arrive at our destination soon enough.<$FFFD>
Very well, let's sally forth.<$FFFE>
Yeahhhh!<$FFFE>
