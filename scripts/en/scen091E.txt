Sorry to keep you waiting.<$FFFE>
Ah, you're back.<$FFFE>
Good to see you again, Lady Jessica.<$FFFE>
Good to see you too, Master Olver.<$FFFD>
My apologies for the haste, but we really need your help.<$FFFE>
No worries.<$FFFD>
These people have given me the specifics.<$FFFC>
We'll need to head to Heaven right away.<$FFFE>
To Heaven?<$FFFE>
That's right.<$FFFD>
To make the Haja no Ken into a holy blade, we need to infuse it with Lady Lushiris's power in Heaven.<$FFFE>
Very well, let's use the power of the Gate to teleport to Heaven.<$FFFE>
Please do.<$FFFE>
Kesle Kehanitos, Kesle Kehanitos.<$FFFD>
Let the seal on the gate of the Goddess be broken so that we might be led to the Goddess's demesne.<$FFFE>
Heaven, Home of the Goddess Lushiris<$FFFF>
So this is Heaven....<$FFFE>
Lady Lushiris.<$FFFE>
We have brought King Sieghart of the Elthlied Kingdom.<$FFFE>
Good work, Jessica.<$FFFE>
It is an honor to meet you in person, Lady Lushiris.<$FFFE>
I have watched over your actions from here.<$FFFC>
You have done an excellent job in dispelling the internal chaos that has plagued the land.<$FFFE>
I have no words to express my gratitude for such praise.<$FFFE>
However, you must be wary of Velzeria's current actions.<$FFFE>
The demons have always planned to rule over the world of humans.<$FFFC>
That's why humans are often manipulated into fighting each other.<$FFFE>
Then, this war was their doing, too!?<$FFFE>
I'm not completely certain.<$FFFC>
No matter what might be said of my powers, I don't know everything about the demons' movements.<$FFFE>
Just as I watch over humanity, so is there a god who watches over the demons.<$FFFE>
So we have to be the ones who directly oppose these foes.<$FFFE>
Now, let's begin the ceremony of reforging the Haja no Ken.<$FFFE>
Place the Haja no Ken here.<$FFFE>
Yes, milady.<$FFFE>
Now, I must ask this one last time.<$FFFD>
King Sieghart.<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
Are you willing to give up your life for the peace of this world?<$FFFE>
....Yes.<$FFFE>
!?<$FFFE>
Very well.<$FFFC>
With that settled, the ceremony can begin.<$FFFE>
....Become the eternal vessel for this righteous soul, with limitless power.....<$FFFE>
....Become the eternal vessel for this righteous soul, instilled with the hope for peace.....<$FFFE>
From now on, the entire world shall be subject to the power of your wish throughout your limitless existence.<$FFFD>
Der Suuld ist Langrisser....<$FFFE>
Father!?<$FFFE>
Lewin, don't worry.<$FFFE>
Father, where are you?<$FFFE>
This ceremony was the secret joining of a human soul and the Haja no Ken.<$FFFE>
That sword is now King Sieghart.<$FFFE>
The sword!?<$FFFE>
....King Sieghart is in the sword?<$FFFE>
....The Langrisser.<$FFFC>
It looks like it is a success.<$FFFE>
The Langrisser?<$FFFE>
In the language of Heaven, it means the sanctified sword.<$FFFE>
The Langrisser.....<$FFFE>
....Father.<$FFFE>
Lewin.<$FFFC>
The Langrisser and I are one.<$FFFC>
I'll always be at your side.<$FFFE>
And, I shall lived for all eternity to maintain the peace for this world.<$FFFE>
I see.<$FFFE>
....The Masayan Sword.<$FFFC>
It looks like it is a success.<$FFFE>
The Masayan Sword?<$FFFD>
It's not the Langrisser?<$FFFE>
You all no longer possess the Langrisser.<$FFFE>
Ah....<$FFFC>
Now that you mention it, I see the difference.<$FFFD>
But, what does that mean.....<$FFFE>
In the language of Heaven.....<$FFFD>
"The sword that was forged from the essence of he who is more likely to cough up blood than curse at adversity, which fails at the worst times"<$FFFD>
....is its meaning.<$FFFE>
Quite a mouthful.....<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
In short, "the worst sword."<$FFFC>
So that's the Masayan Sword.....<$FFFE>
....Father.<$FFFC>
Somehow, I'm ashamed.....<$FFFE>
Lewin.<$FFFD>
Even though I'm in this shape now,<$FFFC>
I will always be with you.<$FFFD>
And, I shall live to better mankind for all eternity.<$FFFE>
R..right.....<$FFFE>
[diehardt's name].<$FFFD>
I think you should take the throne of Elthlied....<$FFFE>
.....<$FFFE>
What's wrong?<$FFFE>
I'm not suited to being a King.<$FFFC>
I appreciate the honor, but I must decline.<$FFFD>
I think it would be best if Lewin became the King of Elthlied.<$FFFC>
That is, if Lewin agrees.<$FFFE>
I see.<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
....I guess that might work.<$FFFE>
Very well, Lady Lushiris.<$FFFD>
We must return to the land and work to stop the plans of Velzeria.<$FFFE>
I leave it to you, my daughter.<$FFFE>
Lady Jessica is Lady Lushiris's daughter!?<$FFFE>
Haha.<$FFFC>
I'm not her daughter in the way you're thinking.<$FFFE>
Jessica serves as my avatar, watching and warding the human world in my stead, since I cannot directly act there.<$FFFD>
However, she really is human, no different from the rest of humanity.<$FFFD>
She uses her own judgement to supporting the human worldview and decide what is best to do at any given time.<$FFFE>
But while we're all here, Velzeria is likely trying to stir up more mischief.<$FFFD>
We'd best return to the earth right away.<$FFFE>
Fare well, Lady Lushiris.<$FFFC>
Using this gift on the earth, we shall work to counter Velzeria.<$FFFE>
I shall wish for everyone's success.<$FFFE>
...........<$FFFE>

                     !<$FFFE>
<$FFFC>
Gahhhhhhh!<$FFFE>
What kind of crazy trick is this?<$FFFE>
<$FFFC>
<$FFFC>
....Sigh.<$FFFE>
Center of Lushiris Gate<$FFFF>
Oh!<$FFFC>
Back already!<$FFFE>
How did it go?<$FFFC>
Were you able to strengthen the Haja no Ken?<$FFFE>
Huh?<$FFFC>
I don't see the King......<$FFFE>
This is Father now.<$FFFE>
Hey now, this is hardly a good time to be telling jokes....<$FFFE>
You can't mean this,<$FFFC>
this pathetic sword.....<$FFFE>
He wasn't joking.<$FFFC>
Because of my desire for peace, my form has changed, but I will always be with you.<$FFFE>
The sword spoke!<$FFFE>
Because King Sieghart has given his soul to the Haja no Ken, it has become the Masayan Sword.<$FFFE>
Because King Sieghart has given his soul to the Haja no Ken, it has become the Langrisser.<$FFFE>
So, Lewin shall now become the King of Elthlied.<$FFFD>
But, for Lewin to become king, we all must fight against Velzeria and any other foes.<$FFFE>
Forgive my selfish request, but I ask that you all give Lewin your allegiance from now on.<$FFFE>
If that is your wish, King Sieghart, so shall it be.<$FFFE>
I'd heard rumors, but I never thought I'd see the mystery of a human soul merged with a sword with my own eyes.<$FFFE>
Anyhow, this isn't a time for tears.<$FFFD>
It's time to celebrate the ascension of a new king!<$FFFE>
That's right.<$FFFE>
..........<$FFFE>
My, what's wrong, [diehardt's name]-san?<$FFFC>
You don't look all that cheerful.<$FFFE>
You can tell us, no need to mask your feelings.....<$FFFE>
Somehow, it feels wrong to use him like this!<$FFFC>
It's no different from what the bad guys do!<$FFFE>
How could something so harsh be just?<$FFFF>
Ugh.....<$FFFE>
You're just being overly negative.<$FFFE>
Bad news!<$FFFE>
What is the matter?<$FFFE>
Someone who claims to be of the Larcuss royal bloodline has appeared at the castle!<$FFFE>
Impossible!<$FFFD>
Didn't the captured nobles testify that every member of the royal family was slain?<$FFFE>
That's right.<$FFFC>
We all witnessed this, too, with our own eyes.<$FFFE>
Well, that was what the message said.<$FFFD>
We have our own legitimate successor to this country's rule.<$FFFC>
Everyone who supports Sieghart needs to return to the royal capitol immediately!<$FFFE>
What in the world could be happening?<$FFFE>
Well, let's hurry back to the castle.<$FFFE>
Somehow, I have a bad feeling about this.<$FFFE>
Lady Jessica.....<$FFFE>
I'll return with you.<$FFFD>
Depending on the circumstances, I'll stand with you in battle.<$FFFE>
<$FFFC>
Jessica joined the party!<$FFFE>
Thank you very much.<$FFFE>
I will come as well.<$FFFE>
Very well.<$FFFC>
Anyhow, let's be on our way to the castle.<$FFFE>
Rigüler - Elthlied Border ~ Outside Imperial Base<$FFFF>
So we've entered into a ceasefire agreement with Elthlied.<$FFFC>
But, Velzeria....<$FFFE>
A vampire bat....?<$FFFE>
Stop that jabbering, Varna.<$FFFE>
A monster!?<$FFFE>
Better not forget that we have your younger sister, Anna.<$FFFD>
If you don't kill Altemüller, her life will be in danger.<$FFFE>
Grrr, ....you underhanded scumbag!<$FFFE>
Hohoho!<$FFFC>
If you value your younger sister's life, you'd better hurry up and kill him.<$FFFD>
Use this poison......<$FFFC>
It has no distinctive taste or smell, and will kill him quickly.<$FFFD>
Just mix it in with some sake, it should be undetectable.....<$FFFE>
Anna and Lord Altemüller both are precious to me......<$FFFE>
I....<$FFFC>
I, I don't know what to do.....<$FFFE>
<$FFFF>
