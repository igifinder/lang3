Your Excellency!<$FFFC>
It's still dangerous to your health to be very active.<$FFFE>
Don't worry about me.<$FFFD>
Thanks to your extensive care, the wound has already closed over, as you can see.<$FFFE>
But, Your Excellency.....<$FFFE>
Excuse me!<$FFFE>
What is it?<$FFFE>
General Bortz has sent a report.<$FFFD>
General Bortz has a feeling that his main force will be overcome by the Larcuss forces led by Lord Raymond, which are stronger than initially suspected!<$FFFE>
That Bortz!?<$FFFE>
Ho....<$FFFC>
That Lord Raymond sure makes things much more exciting.<$FFFE>
What course of action would be best?<$FFFE>
Varna.<$FFFC>
Go and help our Bortz.<$FFFE>
Yessir!<$FFFC>
..But, Your Excellency.....<$FFFE>
No need to worry about me.<$FFFC>
Just go.<$FFFE>
....Your wish is my command.<$FFFE>
Hmmm.....<$FFFD>
This should be very interesting....<$FFFE>
