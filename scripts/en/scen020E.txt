Boarding Pad ~ Near the Larcussia Border Defense Base<$FFFF>
Bortz!<$FFFC>
You won't get away this time!<$FFFE>
You took your sweet time.<$FFFC>
Almost all of our troops has been evacuated by now.<$FFFE>
He isn't called one of the four great generals for nothing.<$FFFC>
They coped well with the situation at hand.<$FFFE>
General.<$FFFC>
The preparations for the last airship's lift-off are complete.<$FFFE>
Good.<$FFFC>
At this rate we should be able to make it.<$FFFC>
It's time for us to head home.<$FFFE>
Damn!<$FFFC>
This will be a close call...<$FFFE>
Sir Diehärte.<$FFFC>
We should make it our goal to capture the enemie's airship.<$FFFE>
This airship is set to fly to Larcussia, is it not?<$FFFE>
I get it!<$FFFC>
If we conquer it we may be able to save Lewin's Father.<$FFFE>
Alright.<$FFFC>
Bring down General Bortz and conquer the airship!<$FFFE>
So that's what their after.<$FFFC>
Protect the General and the airship!<$FFFE>
It would be advisable to take out the archers and spearmen first.<$FFFD>
After that our flying and cavalry units can take on the chase of General Bortz.<$FFFE>
You're right.<$FFFC>
It wouldn't do us any good storming their defensive lines rashly.<$FFFE>
If the spearmen and archers aren't taken care of our flying and cavalry units will have a hard time...<$FFFE>
General, don't push yourself to hard.<$FFFD>
It wouldn't be good to exhaust oneself.<$FFFE>
You're right.<$FFFC>
Yeah yeah, I'll just run home like a good boy.<$FFFE>
It's better not to try ones luck.<$FFFC>
Yeah yeah, I'll just run home like a good boy.<$FFFE>
We have wasted to much time dealing with the common troops, their general is escaping!<$FFFD>
Our last chance is to push through their lines.<$FFFC>
If we fail now we won't make it to Larcussia in time!<$FFFE>
Yeah.<$FFFC>
We can't let that happen.<$FFFE>
There's little time left.<$FFFC>
We need to break through the enemy lines to make it.<$FFFE>
Crap!<$FFFC>
The wounds I received during the last fight started hurting again!<$FFFD>
This is as fast as I can walk.<$FFFE>
Please don't do anything unreasonable.<$FFFD>
We will stall the enemy until you can move onward...<$FFFE>
Please don't do anything unreasonable.<$FFFD>
We will stall the enemy until you can move onward...<$FFFE>
Sorry for being such a bother...<$FFFE>
Keep the enemy busy!<$FFFD>
Gradually fall back and secure a path for General Bortz...<$FFFE>
Charge!<$FFFC>
Let's buy some time for General Bortz!<$FFFE>
Now it's our turn.<$FFFC>
Everyone, move out!<$FFFE>
Hihi, I'll roast them with my magic.<$FFFE>
Well then, let's be outta here.<$FFFE>
We'll cover your retreat!<$FFFE>
Just make your way to the airship, leave everything else to us.<$FFFE>
Thanks, I really owe you.<$FFFE>
It sure is difficult chasing him on this terrain...<$FFFE>
It sure is difficult chasing him on this terrain...<$FFFE>
Usually a wide open space is needed for an airship to maneuver.<$FFFD>
But since we're in a mountainous region this conditions hardly can be met.<$FFFD>
The only place to set up a docking port is that plateau before us.<$FFFE>
Oh.<$FFFC>
You really know your stuff.<$FFFD>
It's almost frightening.<$FFFE>
Hurry to the airship, General Bortz.<$FFFC>
We will hold off the enemy.<$FFFE>
Just be careful.<$FFFE>
Yes, sir!<$FFFE>
General!<$FFFC>
We'll take over from here!<$FFFD>
Don't be tempted to enter battle yourself, we need you alive!<$FFFE>
If it's getting to dangerous you gotta withdraw too!<$FFFC>
And that's an order!<$FFFE>
General!<$FFFC>
We'll take over from here!<$FFFE>
If it's getting to dangerous you gotta withdraw too!<$FFFC>
And that's an order!<$FFFE>
Hurry up, General!<$FFFE>
Okay okay.<$FFFE>
Blasted, we didn't make it in time!<$FFFE>
Phew.<$FFFC>
I'm here at last.<$FFFE>
Glad you made it in one piece.<$FFFE>
It's about time we're leaving...<$FFFE>
Hey now, everyone come quickly!<$FFFE>
Please go first, general.<$FFFE>
Are you crazy!?<$FFFC>
You have to get outta here!<$FFFE>
I'm afraid that this is the one time we cannot listen to your orders, general.<$FFFC>
Please leave while we hold off the enemy.<$FFFD>
You! Get that airship moving!<$FFFE>
Understood.<$FFFC>
We're off then.<$FFFE>
Acting without orders like that!<$FFFC>
Stop this instant!<$FFFE>
Everyone, I've made it.<$FFFC>
I only wished you could be here now...<$FFFE>
The airship took off.<$FFFE>
Our enemies won...<$FFFE>
Since we haven't got an airship there's no way to save Lord Raymond...<$FFFE>
Dammit!<$FFFC>
How the hell did they manage to get in front of me.<$FFFD>
There's no choice but to force my way trough then!<$FFFE>
Okay, I'm feeling better so I'll hurry on now.<$FFFC>
You should make your way to the airship too..<$FFFE>
Understood!<$FFFE>
Somehow I managed to make it this far...<$FFFE>
I'd say it's due to the frantic effort your subordinates are putting up...<$FFFE>
No doubt about it....<$FFFC>
I'm truly blessed having such fine subordinates.<$FFFD>
Now hurry everyone and join up!<$FFFE>
Everyone!<$FFFC>
I've made it to safety!<$FFFD>
All troops cease fighting and fall back to the airship!<$FFFC>
After that we'll meet up wit the main body!<$FFFE>
Don't worry about us just make sure to board the airship.<$FFFC>
We'll follow this instant.<$FFFE>
Roger!<$FFFE>
Just a little further...<$FFFC>
I have to move on for my subordinates who gave everything to me!<$FFFE>
You come across a hill on which some rocks are piled up and a huge hole gasps between them.<$FFFD>
After you stare into it for a while a voice can be heard from somewhere.<$FFFD>
"What is it you desire the most?"<$FFFE>
What do you answer?<$FFFE>
Love<$FFFE>
Power<$FFFE>
Courage<$FFFE>
"Your wish shall be granted."<$FFFE>
"Your wish shall be granted."<$FFFE>
Demon Dragon Stone was obtained!<$FFFE>
"Your wish shall be granted."<$FFFE>
<$f6>Protection<$fc>A rose by 2!<$FFFD>
<$f6>Protection<$fc>D rose by 2!<$FFFE>
A Magical Sign is drawn on the center of the bridge.<$FFFC>
Upon inspecting it closely you notice that one stone is lose.<$FFFE>
What do you do?<$FFFE>
Pull it out<$FFFE>
Push it in<$FFFE>
Do nothing<$FFFE>
The stone comes off easily.<$FFFC>
Underneath you discover a hole containing a ragged book.<$FFFE>
Tome of black magic was obtained!<$FFFE>
The stone got stuck and can't be moved any longer...<$FFFE>
After a while the stone sinks down into the ground and couldn't be moved any longer...<$FFFE>
Even if I die...<$FFFC>
You must carry on...<$FFFE>
Papa...<$FFFE>
I'm sorry, everyone...<$FFFE>
I can't take any more...<$FFFE>
It's hopeless...<$FFFE>
Huh?<$FFFE>
Excuse me...<$FFFE>
Lushiris my goddess...<$FFFE>
Guargh...<$FFFC>
Please look after my...<$FFFE>
Urrgh....<$FFFE>
What a waste...<$FFFE>
Noo!<$FFFC>
We have failed!<$FFFE>
Guaargh!<$FFFC>
...It seems my way ends here...<$FFFC>
If only I could've seen peace returning...<$FFFE>
Emaillink...<$FFFC>
Take good are of the Field Marshal...<$FFFE>
You did well, Sir Diehärte.<$FFFE>
General Bortz...you were a worthy opponent.<$FFFE>
He was a man of honor.<$FFFE>
If circumstances would have been different, I would have liked to have a sake with him sometime.<$FFFE>
Bad news!<$FFFC>
Lord Raymond is about to being transported to Teito!<$FFFE>
What!?<$FFFE>
When?<$FFFE>
What?<$FFFC>
When will it happen?<$FFFE>
Right about now.<$FFFC>
Taking the land rout is out of question by now.<$FFFC>
If you take that airship you may be in time!<$FFFE>
One hardship after another.<$FFFE>
Tell me about it.<$FFFE>
Everyone hurry and board the airship!<$FFFC>
We have to save Lord Raymond!<$FFFE>
Right!<$FFFE>
Keh!<$FFFC>
They caught up to me this fast!?<$FFFE>
Shit!<$FFFC>
They got me flanked!<$FFFC>
You damned fiends!<$FFFE>
Dammit!<$FFFD>
I've made it this far and still my subordinates suffer!<$FFFD>
You'll have to finish this fast!<$FFFE>
General Bortz...<$FFFD>
Please..call my name...<$FFFE>
Forgive me...<$FFFC>
I have failed you all...<$FFFE>
Uwaaah!<$FFFE>
General.<$FFFC>
Take care...<$FFFE>
...Keh.<$FFFC>
If only I had the power to protect them...<$FFFE>
Guwaah!<$FFFE>
It's over for us...<$FFFD>
At least we could help the general somewhat...<$FFFE>
Damn this!<$FFFE>
Don't you dare touch my General!<$FFFE>
I have no regrets...<$FFFE>
You monsters!<$FFFE>
You won't lay even a finger on the General!<$FFFE>
I don't wanna die...<$FFFE>
My sword...is so heavy...<$FFFE>
Defeat tastes bitter...<$FFFC>
We have been defeated...<$FFFE>
It is beautiful...<$FFFE>
My vision grows hazy...<$FFFE>
I'm dying...<$FFFE>
Why did you have to come here!?<$FFFE>
I was careless...<$FFFE>
Why doesn't my sword skill match theirs!?<$FFFE>
Uuu...<$FFFC>
It hurts...<$FFFE>
Gaarghh!<$FFFE>
This is as far as my life force lasts!<$FFFE>
Kyaah!<$FFFE>
Keh! Forgive me!<$FFFC>
If only I had more power you could be still living right now and we all could return together...<$FFFD>
But I'll return to the empire in your place.<$FFFC>
Your sacrifice won't be in vain!<$FFFE>
Such senseless destruction of life...<$FFFE>
General!<$FFFC>
We'll try to buy some time.<$FFFD>
Please just keep moving towards the ship!<$FFFE>
What are you saying!?<$FFFC>
I won't abandon you like that!<$FFFD>
I'll fight too!<$FFFE>
We already have been defeated.<$FFFC>
Right now our only option is to retreat!<$FFFE>
We already have been defeated.<$FFFC>
Right now our only option is to retreat!<$FFFE>
I'm sorry...<$FFFE>
<$FFFF>
