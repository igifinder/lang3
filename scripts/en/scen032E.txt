Death of [diehardt's name]<$FFFE>
Barral Kingdom ~ Defensive Position<$FFFF>
...I still can't believe it.<$FFFC>
How could the Dark Knight be defeated?<$FFFE>
When I received the report I couldn't believe my ears.<$FFFC>
I too thought the Dark Knight to be unbeatable...<$FFFE>
Princess! The enemy has appeared!FFFC>
After all it seems to be the truth that the Dark Knight has fallen.<$FFFE>
Don't panic!<$FFFC>
Our defence here has never crumbled before.<$FFFC>
Fight defensively and we surely will be victorious.<$FFFE>
Blazes!<$FFFC>
They've put up some tough looking defence.<$FFFE>
The princess is proud of this spot being the perfect place for thwarting any attempt to assault the Barral Kingdom.<$FFFE>
She is quiet the brave princess to command the troops herself, don't you think?<$FFFE>
You can say that again.<$FFFC>
Her offensive abilities are good but her defensive skills are her real strong point.<$FFFC>
We will have a hard time here for sure.<$FFFD>
...Luckily it seems that, despite the King's and Dark Knight's madness the princess is still herself.<$FFFE>
We should try to avoid any meaningless fighting with her.<$FFFE>
Yeah.<$FFFE>
...Flaire!<$FFFC>
Listen to me!<$FFFE>
What is your business here?<$FFFE>
Flaire.<$FFFC>
We have no desire to do senseless battle.<$FFFC>
Please let us through to meet with King Wilder.<$FFFE>
So you are after my father's life?<$FFFE>
We only want to talk to him.<$FFFE>
I cannot believe you.<$FFFC>
It is my duty to protect the king from any danger.<$FFFC>
Therefore you will not pass.<$FFFE>
You may have defeated the Dark Knight but don't think you will have so much luck a second time!<$FFFE>
Flaire!<$FFFE>
What should we do,[diehardt's name]?<$FFFE>
If Velzeria is related to this, the longer we do nothing the worse it will get.<$FFFE>
...We have to persuade Flaire somehow.<$FFFC>
Everyone if I can explain the situation to Flaire I'm sure she'll cooperate.<$FFFE>
In this case we should concentrate only on securing a path to her.<$FFFE>
Leave it to me!<$FFFC>
I've got your back!<$FFFE>
Everyone, I put my faith in you!<$FFFE>
Charge!<$FFFE>
Vanguard troops mobilize.<$FFFC>
Don't let them through!<$FFFE>
Understood!<$FFFC>
Commencing to eliminate the enemy.<$FFFE>
Healing units support the others from the back!<$FFFE>
Leave it in our care!<$FFFE>
All troops, move out!<$FFFC>
If we can't hold this position our lives will be forfeited!<$FFFC>
Crush the enemy!<$FFFE>
Understood!<$FFFE>
How did we end up fighting like this [diehardt's name]...<$FFFE>
Princess we will protect you with our lives.<$FFFE>
Thank you...<$FFFC>
Retreat if it gets too dangerous.<$FFFD>
There are families you need to take care of.<$FFFE>
Princess...<$FFFE>
The outcome of this battle will decide the fate of Barrel!<$FFFD>
Remember that even a small force can best a large one if the advantage is on their side!<$FFFC>
Stay strong!<$FFFE>
Yeaaah!<$FFFE>
As expected they are coming across the bridge...<$FFFD>
Ranged units!<$FFFC>
Aim with utmost accuracy!<$FFFC>
Sorcerers move on to the attack!<$FFFE>
Understood.<$FFFE>
Flaire!<$FFFC>
Please hear me out!<$FFFE>
The sudden change of King Wilder's personality is just too strange.<$FFFC>
You must have noticed yourself right?<$FFFE>
.....<$FFFE>
You come across a conspicuous spot of barren land.<$FFFE>
Do you want to inspect it more closely?<$FFFE>
You discover two closed boxes in the dirt.<$FFFE>
Do you want to open one of them?<$FFFE>
The smaller one<$FFFE>
The larger one<$FFFE>
Don't open any<$FFFE>
Upon opening the box, a ray off light flashes towards you.<$FFFE>
Divine Blessing was obtained!<$FFFE>
Out of nowhere an enormous bird appears and flies off.<$FFFC>
holding the box you didn't chose in its claws...<$FFFE>
An ancient book was found inside.<$FFFE>
Book of Mysteries was obtained!<$FFFE>
Out of nowhere an enormous bird appears and flies off.<$FFFC>
holding the box you didn't chose in its claws...<$FFFE>
Out of nowhere an enormous bird appears and flies off,<$FFFC>
taking both boxes away...<$FFFE>
Halt!<$FFFE>
You may not pass through!<$FFFE>
You sadden me, Flaire...<$FFFC>
We haven't come to do battle.<$FFFD>
We just want to meet King Wilder to uncover the truth behind all of this!<$FFFD>
That's why I'm asking you to step aside!<$FFFE>
I will do no such thing!<$FFFC>
You are no other than any other invader in my eyes!<$FFFE>
You shall feel our wrath for this act of aggression!<$FFFE>
Don't place yourself in our way!<$FFFE>
There's no turning back for any of us!<$FFFE>
This is as far as you get!<$FFFE>
You will not pass through here!<$FFFE>
Return to where you came from!<$FFFE>
<$F702><$F702>N..No!<$FFFD>
Flaire...<$FFFE>
Good bye, [diehardt's name]...<$FFFE>
Kyaaaah!<$FFFC>
This was unnecessary...<$FFFE>
Ugh...<$FFFC>
Where's my power...<$FFFE>
What!?<$FFFC>
This can't be...<$FFFE>
What excessiveness.<$FFFC>
Not now...<$FFFE>
Farewell, Diehärte...<$FFFC>
I'm so tired....<$FFFE>
I'm going to rest...just a little bit...<$FFFE>
...I'm done....<$FFFE>
Tough luck...<$FFFC>
How's that possible....<$FFFE>
Grrr....<$FFFE>
I'm sorry, Diehärte...<$FFFC>
We were so close to our goal...<$FFFE>
Grrr!<$FFFC>
One shouldn't throw ones live away carelessly...<$FFFD>
It is unfortunate but retreat seems to be the only option.<$FFFE>
Forgive me, but I need to rest a little.<$FFFE>
My power wasn't enough...<$FFFE>
Uuh...Ughh.<$FFFC>
My sword is eluding the grasp of my hand....<$FFFE>
Kyaahh!<$FFFE>
Such a horrible thing to do...<$FFFE>
Why...<$FFFE>
Oh Goddess...<$FFFE>
It's hopeless already...<$FFFE>
Forgive me...princess...<$FFFE>
Uaaargh!<$FFFE>
Is this...the realm of the gods...?<$FFFE>
Not like this...<$FFFE>
I want power....!<$FFFE>
Just my cursed luck...<$FFFE>
I expected no less of the ones who defeated the dark knight...<$FFFE>
My body is collapsing....<$FFFE>
My spear...where's my spear...<$FFFE>
Ahh...please...don't...<$FFFE>
My sword was not enough...<$FFFE>
So...cruel...<$FFFE>
This doesn't look well...<$FFFE>
That's not how it should be....<$FFFE>
P..Princess...<$FFFC>
Run...<$FFFE>
Will I ever see the blue sky again..?<$FFFE>
Save...the princess...<$FFFE>
Grrr...how could I....<$FFFE>
Dying is such sweet sorrow....<$FFFE>
I won't go down like this!<$FFFC>
I hate this tainted world...<$FFFE>
Defend the Princess to the last man!<$FFFE>
A..After everything that happened...<$FFFC>
If only my magic worked...<$FFFE>
My last spell....<$FFFE>
Protect the Princess!<$FFFE>
My charge failed...<$FFFE>
It was a good life...<$FFFE>
All troops have been wiped out?<$FFFC>
That's....<$FFFD>
Unforgivable...<$FFFC>
But I'll fight to the bitter end, for Barral!<$FFFE>
Aahhh...<$FFFC>
It hadn't have to come to this...<$FFFE>
There's always a better way...<$FFFE>
The Elthlied troops are advancing!<$FFFE>
Princess.<$FFFC>
Diehärte, you have come all this way for naught!<$FFFE>
Dios you damn traitor...<$FFFC>
Have you come back to murder my father!?<$FFFE>
Tch!<$FFFC>
Such persistence!<$FFFE>
There is the possibility that King Wilder is being manipulated by Velzeria.<$FFFD>
Wouldn't that explain everything King Wilder has done of late?<$FFFE>
Listen to me carefully Flaire!<$FFFE>
In truth the Dark Knight was Geriord.<$FFFE>
We could still sense the dark magic around him.<$FFFC>
He was being used by the Velzerians.<$FFFE>
Perhaps his and King Wilder's transfiguration is due to some dark magic.<$FFFE>
The person affected becomes a walking corpse stripped of his own will.<$FFFE>
Impossible! Father...<$FFFE>
We only want to investigate if that is the case.<$FFFE>
If fortune smiles upon us we might be able to rescue the King from the spell!<$FFFE>
....But...<$FFFE>
Please believe me Flaire!<$FFFE>
...I believe you.<$FFFE>
Even if chances are slim, you may be able to help my father being himself again.<$FFFE>
Flaire...<$FFFE>
It's painful to admit but I can't do anything else for him.<$FFFC>
Neither can I endure seeing him in his current state any longer...<$FFFD>
Please try to rescue my father...<$FFFE>
I promise Flaire.<$FFFC>
We will do our utmost to rescue King Wilder!<$FFFE>
Thank you, [diehardt's name].<$FFFC>
...I'd like to help too.<$FFFE>
Huh?!<$FFFE>
Well, I can handle myself in battle<$FFFC>
and my knowledge about the castle should prove somewhat useful.<$FFFE>
You're right, I'm counting on you.<$FFFE>
Flair joins the division!<$FFFE>
...Not long ago, I was out in the forest hunting on my own and followed my prey deep into the forest.<$FFFE>
When I didn't come home Father and some of his subordinates came looking for me.<$FFFC>
The fleeing prey had startled father's horse and father fell from a cliff.<$FFFE>
It was a miracle that he wasn't injured seriously.<$FFFC>
However...<$FFFE>
...Flaire.<$FFFE>
...Afterwards.<$FFFC>
The kind father I knew was no more.<$FFFE>
It was all my fault!<$FFFC>
Father only changed because of my mindlessness!<$FFFC>
That's what I believe.<$FFFE>
Please everyone you must leave here, there is nothing you can do to help!!<$FFFE>
The enemy has come!<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
Protect the princess with your lives!<$FFFE>
