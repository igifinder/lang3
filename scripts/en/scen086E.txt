Scenario ~ 23<$FFFC>
"Necromancy, Redux"<$FFFE>
At last, Velzeria has begun to mobilize.  But, their movements<$FFFC>
have been cloaked in shadows.  Now, Grove has led a legion<$FFFC>
of monsters against a village on the Elthlead border.<$FFFE>
[diehardt's name] and company overcome their fatigue and set out towards the border village in order to save the villagers.<$FFFE>
*Condition for Victory<$FFFC>
 -Defeat of all enemies<$FFFC>
*Conditions for Defeat<$FFFC>
 -Death of [diehardt's name]<$FFFC>
 -Death of all NPCs<$FFFE>
Village along the Velzeria ~ Elthlead Border<$FFFF>
How in the world have we come to such a sordid state of affairs, that monsters infest our countryside?<$FFFE>
Lately, they've come frequently.<$FFFD>
This village hasn't been hit hard, but the neighboring villages have been completely destroyed by the monsters.<$FFFE>
Has Lady Lushiris forsaken us?<$FFFE>
O..o..oh no!<$FFFC>
Monsters, again!<$FFFE>
Say what!?<$FFFE>
Goaah!<$FFFE>
Run!<$FFFC>
Everyone, get out of here!<$FFFE>
Rigüler Imperial Capitol ~ Main Street<$FFFF>
....His Imperial Majesty....<$FFFE>
....I wonder why our country's Kaiser didn't rule for very long?<$FFFE>
The imperial family member's historically have lived long lives, right......<$FFFE>
Think someone might have murdered him?<$FFFE>
Hey....<$FFFE>
Sir!<$FFFE>
What are you all chattering about?<$FFFE>
Umm.....forgive us.<$FFFE>
Since his Imperial Highness has passed away, it would be wise to stow unnecessary chatter.<$FFFE>
My humble apologies.<$FFFE>
....Hmmph.<$FFFE>
..........<$FFFE>
Rigüler Imperial Castle ~ Altemüller's Personal Room<$FFFF>
Did you see that?<$FFFC>
The look on Paul's face during the time of the funeral procession.<$FFFE>
Yes, sir.<$FFFE>
Even though his father has passed he way, he had that look of smug satisfaction.<$FFFC>
....Argh, what a bastard!<$FFFE>
Excuse me.<$FFFE>
You called me, Your Excellency Altemüller?<$FFFE>
Thanks for responding to my summons.<$FFFC>
I've got something I'd like to ask you.<$FFFE>
Yes, milord, how might I help you?<$FFFE>
You attended both my Father, the previous Kaiser, and Kaiser Kleist IV in their final days, correct?<$FFFE>
That is correct.<$FFFE>
....Then, let me frank with you - what do you think the true cause of death was for both of them?<$FFFE>
..........<$FFFE>
Don't worry.<$FFFC>
Just tell us what you really think.<$FFFE>
....Please forgive my fear.<$FFFE>
I've tended many people to their final moments, as a healer.<$FFFC>
However, I don't believe those two honorable personages died from ordinary illnesses.<$FFFE>
Their faces turned a purple color, their skin began to turn yellowish in places, yet whatever medicine I prepared, their bodies still grew weaker.....<$FFFE>
This is just a guess, but I believe someone might have poisoned them.....<$FFFE>
Poison?<$FFFE>
I know no more; this is all just wild speculation.<$FFFE>
Because of my shortcomings in study, it might have just been some unknown disease.<$FFFE>
.....Thanks so much.<$FFFC>
You may leave now.<$FFFE>
....One warning, though.<$FFFC>
Don't tell His Majesty Paul what we spoke of here, on pain of death.<$FFFE>
Y...yes, sir......<$FFFC>
Then, if I might be excused.<$FFFE>
So it looks like they were murdered by poison after all.<$FFFC>
.....Paul, you bastard.<$FFFE>
Your Excellency, what shall we do?<$FFFE>
....We can't rush this kind of thing.<$FFFC>
I can't let them think this talk of poison is just an excuse to take the throne.<$FFFE>
I must recover my honor.<$FFFC>
Only after proving myself worthy will I ascend the throne.<$FFFE>
And to do that, now we must capture Elthlead!<$FFFE>
Sir!<$FFFE>
<$FFFF>
