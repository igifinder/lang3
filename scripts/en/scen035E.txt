It is too quiet...<$FFFE>
Be on your guard.<$FFFC>
There is a strong presence of the Demon Tribe around.<$FFFE>
The throne room is farther inside, most likely he'll be there.<$FFFE>
Muhahaha!<$FFFC>
How nice of you to pay me a visit.<$FFFE>
And delivering the traitor Emaillink no less.<$FFFE>
Show yourself!<$FFFC>
Altemüller!<$FFFE>
I have no intention to run or hide from you.<$FFFC>
But don't be so impatient, you all will be blessed by death soon enough!<$FFFE>
Stay right where you are, Altemüller!<$FFFE>
By the way, is it important in which way we strike him down?<$FFFE>
What do you mean, just hit him hard!<$FFFE>
No!<$FFFC>
He is only possessed by Alhazard.<$FFFD>
Our goal is to return him to his true self, if we simply use force he might die.<$FFFD>
...If we somehow can reach the remnants of his heart we may have a chance.<$FFFE>
...I see.<$FFFD>
It was his furious anger about Varna's death that made him take Alhazard.<$FFFD>
If we somehow could persuade her...we may be able to...<$FFFE>
Yes, I'm sure that this would be our best chance to turn him back <$FFFE>
But what do we do then?<$FFFE>
Maybe...<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
If at all, something like this would be possible with the Langrisser.<$FFFE>
The problem is, how do we reach his original heart?<$FFFD>
If he can recover his own heart even a little Langrisser could expel Alhazard's bewitchment.<$FFFE>
It could be possible with Langrisser.<$FFFE>
The problem is how we can reach his original heart.<$FFFD>
If he can recover his own heart even a little Langrisser could expel Alhazard's bewitchment.<$FFFE>
...This will be my role to play.<$FFFD>
I think I can bring him back to his senses if I get the chance to speak to him.<$FFFE>
Emaillink!?<$FFFE>
If any of us can reach him it would be me.<$FFFE>
He's right, he would be the obvious choice.<$FFFE>
Alright.<$FFFC>
I leave the persuasion to you Emaillink.<$FFFD>
And while Altemüller recovers some of his heart I'll confront him with Langerisser!<$FFFE>
That's some bold plan, what if it doesn't work out?<$FFFE>
But, if we fail...<$FFFE>
...If we fail and Böser fully awakens, there will be nothing we can do for his Excellency but to end his suffering!<$FFFE>
Emaillink...<$FFFE>
But not all hope is lost yet, let's do our best...<$FFFE>
Now that's the spirit!<$FFFE>
Your Excellency...<$FFFE>
You dare to show your face to me after you turned traitor.<$FFFD>
After all those years I looked after you, you repay me by befriending my enemies.<$FFFE>
Do not mistake my actions.<$FFFC>
Right now you are possessed by this cursed sword.<$FFFE>
But soon your true shape will be Altemüller!<$FFFE>
For the first time I take up arms against you.<$FFFC>
Let us see what will come of it.<$FFFE>
Never would I have thought it possible that you betray me, Varna!<$FFFE>
Forgive me, Lord Altemüller.<$FFFC>
What I do is only for the sake of his Excellency.<$FFFE>
You're uttering the same nonsense Emaillink did!<$FFFD>
If that is your wish, your life shall be forfeited!<$FFFE>
[diehardt's name]!<$FFFC>
Not only Emaillink but also Varna was swayed by your treacherous seduction.<$FFFD>
For this you shall know the extend of my wrath, when I tear you limb from limb!<$FFFC>
Prepare yourself!<$FFFE>
Not only Emaillink, but Varna has turned against me.<$FFFD>
Your skill to poison the mind of others is praiseworthy, [diehardt's name].<$FFFC>
Varna's death is weighing heavy upon me.<$FFFD>
You will know my wrath when I fill my halls with your blood.<$FFFC>
Prepare yourself!<$FFFE>
Dammit!<$FFFE>
[diehardt's name].<$FFFC>
I'm afraid his Excellency is beyond rescue already.<$FFFD>
But let us not lose hope till this <$FFFE>
Okay.<$FFFE>
Not only Emaillink, but Varna has turned against me.<$FFFD>
You skill to poison the mind of others is praiseworthy, [diehardt's name].<$FFFE>
What!?<$FFFE>
Altemüller will be save once I cut off the wicked heart with Langrisser!<$FFFE>
Langrisser, lend me your power!<$FFFE>
Be gone!<$FFFD>
Heed my call Langrisser!<$FFFE>
Lend me your strength!<$FFFD>
Father, give me strength!<$FFFE>
Alright!<$FFFC>
Take Cover!<$FFFE>
OK!<$FFFC>
Lure the enemy away from Altemüller!<$FFFE>
Gotcha.<$FFFC>
Try to hold your ground!<$FFFE>
We are counting on you, Sir Diehärte!<$FFFE>
Understood.<$FFFD>
Lushiris....Langrisser...<$FFFC>
Lend me your power!<$FFFE>
Ugh.<$FFFC>
I can't go any further.<$FFFE>
Alright!<$FFFE>
I'll carry on from here on out!<$FFFE>
Just leave it all to me!<$FFFE>
Understood.<$FFFC>
I leave that Langrisser-stuff in your care!<$FFFE>
Understood!<$FFFE>
Alright.<$FFFC>
I will pray for your success!<$FFFE>
With Langrisser on our side we have nothing to worry about.<$FFFC>
Please lend us your power, Langrisser!<$FFFE>
No, we have failed!<$FFFC>
No there's no one left to wield Langrisser...<$FFFD>
Now it's impossible to rescue Altemüller...<$FFFE>
We have to give it our best...<$FFFC>
Maybe Altemüller can recover by himself....<$FFFE>
They won't be satisfied until everyone is dead...<$FFFC>
Kill them all!<$FFFE>
GUOOOO!<$FFFE>
Move out!<$FFFC>
Don't let them get past here!<$FFFE>
GAAAAAA!<$FFFE>
Yessir!<$FFFE>
Move out!<$FFFE>
Here they come!!<$FFFC>
Protect lord Böser to the last breath!<$FFFE>
.<$fe><$14>.<$fe><$14>..<$FFFE>
What's the matter, Emaillink?<$FFFE>
Is it.<$fe><$14>.<$fe><$14>.<$fe><$14>.,Lady Varna?<$FFFE>
You did well making it this far!<$FFFC>
As a reward for your efforts I will let you bear witness the true power of Alhazard!<$FFFD>
Come forth, my servants!<$FFFE>
Well then, come to me now.<$FFFC>
And die at my own hand.<$FFFC>
Hahahaha....<$FFFE>
Hold it right there, Emaillink!<$FFFE>
If you make one more step towards lord Böser I won't hesitate to cut you down.<$FFFE>
Please hear me out Varna.<$FFFE>
The reason for me to support Elthlead is to save his Excellency.<$FFFE>
To save...his Excellency?<$FFFE>
Exactly.<$FFFC>
Right now his Excellency is no longer himself.<$FFFE>
Despite that I never lost faith in him.<$FFFC>
I believe that his noble and kind heart is still there.<$FFFE>
Please cooperate with us, Varna!<$FFFE>
Such a thing....<$FFFC>
His Excellency has changed only because of me.<$FFFE>
There is no way I could ever betray his Excellency!<$FFFE>
And you mustn't!<$FFFC>
If you truly love his Excellency you won't leave him in his current state!<$FFFE>
It was his frantic love for you that brought him to madness and only your love can bring him back to his senses!<$FFFE>
I beseech you, Varna!<$FFFC>
Only with your help will we have a chance to bring him back!<$FFFE>
You are Böser's fiercest enemy!<$FFFC>
Therefore I will now put an end to you!<$FFFE>
Wait, please listen to me!<$FFFE>
Altemüller's heart is currently under the control of Alhazard!<$FFFE>
He only picked up Alhazard because he was furious about your death!<$FFFE>
I'm very much aware of that!<$FFFE>
So you must realize that only you can bring him back to his senses!<$FFFE>
Now to you, traitor!<$FFFC>
You will get an especially extensive treatment!<$FFFE>
To think that even you would turn against me, Varna!<$FFFC>
Prepare to receive your punishment!<$FFFE>
Your Excellency....<$FFFE>
Your Excellency!<$FFFC>
Please lend me your ear!<$FFFE>
I have no use for your mindless babbling!<$FFFE>
Yeah..<$FFFE>
We have to save Altemüller!<$FFFC>
Out of my way!<$FFFE>
A..Altemüller...<$FFFE>
The world of darkness awaits you!<$FFFC>
Hahahaha!<$FFFE>
Why are you staring at me like this!<$FFFE>
I raise my blade to protect the world that Coty loved so much!<$FFFE>
D..Damn...<$FFFE>
...So this is the extend of my power...<$FFFE>
F..Father...<$FFFE>
Why did this....?<$FFFC>
Where does these flowers come from...<$FFFE>
Hah, what a failure...<$FFFE>
Ah...I suddenly feel so alone...<$FFFE>
Oh no!<$FFFE>
Guooon!<$FFFE>
Urg, what did I...<$FFFE>
I..failed!?<$FFFE>
The demon sword has to be..sealed...<$FFFE>
...This shall be my and your last battle.<$FFFC>
Now, come at me!<$FFFE>
..I have..no regrets..<$FFFC>
Leave this to me.<$FFFE>
If just Alhazard didn't exist, father wouldn't...<$FFFE>
[diehardt's name]...<$FFFC>
All that matters now is that Alhazard is sealed...<$FFFE>
Pana Pureho Guna,<$FFFC>
Kaparapa Buu...<$FFFC>
...Shika....<$FFFE>
Shikashikatsuu!<$FFFC>
...hm?<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
Shikaaaa!<$FFFE>
Varna...<$FFFE>
...Please, say no more...<$FFFE>
Please return to us quickly!<$FFFC>
Your Excellency Altemüller!<$FFFE>
[diehardt's name]....his Excellency is lost...<$FFFE>
Emaillink...<$FFFE>
At least <$FFFE>
If you do that for me I can die without any regret!!<$FFFE>
Altemüller!<$FFFC>
Wake up from this nightmare!<$FFFE>
If it isn't my favourite traitor!<$FFFC>
I will repay your years of service with a quick death!<$FFFE>
Once I looked up to you.<$FFFC>
That's why I will put you out of your misery!<$FFFC>
This will be my final service to you!<$FFFE>
Your Excellency!<$FFFC>
Please remember.<$FFFD>
You once were a proud and noble man.<$FFFE>
Silence!<$FFFE>
Just die already!<$FFFC>
Like the worthless insect you are!!<$FFFE>
Damn!<$FFFC>
My head feels like it's about to burst...<$FFFE>
Guargh!?<$FFFE>
Did we do it!?<$FFFE>
The power of Alhazard....fades away...<$FFFC>
...how did...<$FFFE>
...this is...my end...<$FFFC>
Uuarrrghh!<$FFFE>
Yes,....now your free of Böser's curse Altemüller.<$FFFC>
And I shall accompany you in death.<$FFFE>
W..Wait!<$FFFE>
We'll be together once again...<$FFFE>
...Dammit!<$FFFE>
....<$FFFE>
Your Excellency Altemüller, please rest in peace...<$FFFE>
...There will be time to mourn the dead.<$FFFC>
But right now we must seal Alhazard....<$FFFE>
...Your right.<$FFFC>
Prepare the ceremony...<$FFFE>
...There will be time to mourn the dead.<$FFFC>
But right now we must seal Alhazard....<$FFFE>
For opposing master Böser you will be eliminated!<$FFFE>
Damn this!<$FFFC>
What a nuisance!<$FFFE>
Ur...arrgh!<$FFFC>
...My body is falling apart...<$FFFE>
It doesn't look good, Varna.<$FFFD>
But don't worry.<$FFFC>
After I deal with this rabble I will revive you once again...<$FFFE>
...The same method...won't work again, this is my last goodbye...<$FFFE>
Varna!<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
...I won't allow it!<$FFFC>
I won't allow it, [diehardt's name]!<$FFFD>
You took Emaillink and Varna from me!<$FFFD>
You made me watch a second time how the one I love the most dies...<$FFFC>
And I will find a way to bring her back!<$FFFD>
I won't be left alone like this!<$FFFC>
I will lay the world to waste if that's what it takes!<$FFFC>
And I'll start with you!<$FFFE>
Varna!?<$FFFC>
Be strong Varna!<$FFFE>
...My time has come.<$FFFC>
I must endure the pain to say farewell again...<$FFFE>
Varnaa!<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
You made me watch the one I love the most die a second time...<$FFFD>
...But my precious one will soon be brimming with life once again!<$FFFD>
...I will not allow her to die!<$FFFC>
I won't be left alone like this!<$FFFD>
I will lay the world to waste if that's what it takes!<$FFFC>
And I'll start with you!<$FFFE>
For master Böser!<$FFFE>
GRRRR.....<$FFFE>
GRRRR.....<$FFFE>
Guaah!<$FFFE>
Finally...hell...<$FFFE>
GOOOON!<$FFFE>
I thought our victory was sure...<$FFFE>
I'll wait for you in hell...<$FFFE>
Hihihi, come to me...<$FFFE>
Kyaaahhh!<$FFFE>
Urgh...<$FFFE>
I will...return..one day..<$FFFE>
Well then,<$FFFC>
Let's see if you got what it takes to satisfy me...<$FFFE>
Too much...<$FFFE>
GOOOON!<$FFFE>
GOOOON!<$FFFE>
GAHAA!<$FFFE>
GWASAYA!<$FFFE>
GWASAYA!<$FFFE>
GAHAA!<$FFFE>
I'm leaving...this world...<$FFFE>
So, dark...<$FFFE>
Ne..never....<$FFFE>
GGGOOOOOWWWW!<$FFFE>
GRRRR...<$FFFE>
GYAAAH!<$FFFE>
My..body..is...so light....<$FFFE>
God of darkness take me in....<$FFFE>
Humans are...mean..<$FFFE>
KISYHAAAA!<$FFFE>
GRRRR...<$FFFE>
ZUUUUU....<$FFFE>
...No, it's just that Alhazard possesses him.<$FFFD>
If Alhazard's power would be gone, he would turn back to his true self.<$FFFE>
Now I get it!<$FFFC>
Langrisser was created for the very purpose of opposing Alhazard's dark power!<$FFFE>
.<$fe><$14>.<$fe><$14>.<$fe><$14>..<$FFFE>
...His true self.<$FFFC>
His Excellency's true self.<$FFFC>
The tender Altemüller of once.<$FFFE>
If that could become reality there would be no regrets left!<$FFFC>
I have no greater desire than to save Altemüller before my body decays once again!<$FFFE>
Thank you, Varna.<$FFFE>
After I try to persuade his Excellency,<$FFFC>
you should take over, Varna.<$FFFE>
Alright.<$FFFD>
But know that the moment you try to bring harm to his Excellency, I will turn against you.<$FFFE>
Understood.<$FFFE>
Once more I have to say farewell to this world!?<$FFFC>
I will not allow that to happen!<$FFFE>
...just knowing..that you loved me...<$FFFC>
Was enough make my heart overflow with happiness.<$FFFD>
...Thank you....<$FFFE>
Your Excellency!<$FFFC>
Remember that you took Alhazard to strike down the ones that hurt your beloved Varna.<$FFFE>
Now that Geier and Paul are dead, you have no reason anymore to wield that sword.<$FFFE>
You don't seem to understand the amazing powers of this sword.<$FFFC>
Only with them could Varna be brought back to me.<$FFFE>
Think about it, if it wouldn't have been for that sword,<$FFFC>
Varna wouldn't have been involved with Velzeria to begin with!<$FFFE>
In that case also your Excellency's sorrow wouldn't have come to be.<$FFFC>
Everything Alhazard does is driving you mad.<$FFFE>
...If this sword wouldn't exist....<$FFFE>
Exactly!<$FFFC>
Please realize!<$FFFC>
Your Excellency, Altemüller!<$FFFE>
That's right...<$FFFC>
If Alhazard didn't exist...Varna wouldn't have...<$FFFE>
And Varna's resurrection....Uarrgh!<$FFFC>
What's happening...my head...!<$FFFE>
Your Excellency!<$FFFC>
Please hold on!<$FFFE>
Your Excellency, Altemüller!<$FFFE>
Yes, Varna...I...<$FFFE>
Please remember!<$FFFC>
Your noble heart!<$FFFE>
That you're Altemüller!<$FFFE>
...Verily, I'm Altemüller...<$FFFC>
and not the Prince of Darkness, Böser...Uaargh!<$FFFE>
What is happening to him!?<$FFFE>
It seems like his original heart and Alhazard are fighting.<$FFFE>
It seems like his original heart and Alhazard are fighting.<$FFFE>
Doesn't it seem like his original heart and Alhazard are fighting?<$FFFE>
In other words there is still something left of his true self right?<$FFFE>
This is my chance!<$FFFC>
Now, all I need to do is to use Langrisser to cut off his wicked heart! <$FFFE>
...That is one possible outcome.<$FFFC>
There still is a risk that he will pass away.<$FFFE>
Even in death there is life.<$FFFC>
If I'll die a flower shall bloom on my grave to live in my stead!<$FFFE>
...Your Excellency...<$FFFE>
As long as Alhazard exists it is a thread to this world.<$FFFC>
We can't take the risk of doing the same mistake again!<$FFFE>
...It's hopeless...<$FFFE>
...Emaillink?<$FFFE>
<$F702><$F702>...I understand.<$FFFE>
Please don't let his Excellency suffer!<$FFFC>
Deliver him to death!<$FFFE>
Uh..my...body..<$FFFE>
Huh, Varna!?<$FFFC>
How is this?<$FFFC>
But Geier killed you...<$FFFE>
Let's talk about the details later.<$FFFC>
Right now, sealing Alhazard takes priority.<$FFFE>
Forgive me, [diehardt's name].<$FFFC>
It looks like I caused great turmoil.<$FFFE>
What do you reply?<$FFFE>
In the end everything worked out, so it's alright.<$FFFE>
Don't worry about it.<$FFFE>
In the end everything worked out, so it's alright.<$FFFC>
Don't worry about it.<$FFFE>
Everyone is still alive.<$FFFC>
So don't worry too much.<$FFFE>
Now, let us begin the ceremony without further delay.<$FFFE>
Now, let us begin the ceremony without further delay.<$FFFE>
Do you have enough?<$FFFE>
Gurghuu...<$FFFC>
I'm not done yet.<$FFFE>
Your struggle is in vain!<$FFFC>
We have failed to return him to his original self...<$FFFE>
Uuurrrhg!<$FFFC>
Alhazard!<$FFFC>
Grant me your power!<$FFFE>
It's useless, Altemüller!<$FFFC>
In your state you are not able to call forth the powers of Alhazard anymore.<$FFFE>
Your Excellency!?<$FFFE>
Are you back to yourself?<$FFFE>
I am; the last thing I know is that I took Alhazard to exact revenge on Varna's murderers...<$FFFE>
Altemüller...<$FFFE>
Your skill is remarkable,[diehardt's name].<$FFFD>
Go now, you must stop him!<$FFFE>
....It seems like nothing can be done anymore. I can't endure to look at his Excellency any longer. YOu must end it now...<$FFFE>
