Scenario ~ 01<$FFFC>
"Assault on the Floating Castle"<$FFFE>
For times immemorial the Kingdom of Larcuss prospered<$FFFC>
and stood up against the ambitious Rigüler Empire to the north,<$FFFC>
while allying with the Barral Kingdom to the south.<$FFFC>
By the sovereign power of a floating fortress, hovering over its capital Larcussia,<$FFFC>
peace remained throughout the lands.<$FFFE>
Today, inside the same castle, a young man concludes his training as a knight<$FFFC>
by absolving the ceremony of ascension.<$FFFC>
It was [diehardt's name] Klaus who overcame all hardships while undergoing the rigorous knightly training.<$FFFC>
Now his many efforts would bear fruit<$FFFC>
and his dream since childhood should finally become a reality.<$FFFE>
Little did he know, that this happy occasion soon would <$FFFC>
be overshadowed by black wings of foreboding demise,<$FFFC>
which already approached the Floating Castle stealthily.<$FFFE>
*Conditions for Victory<$FFFC>
 -Total destruction of the enemy <$FFFC>
*Conditions for Defeat<$FFFC>
 -Death of [diehardt's name]<$FFFE>
Floating Castle ~ Underground Altar<$FFFF>
[diehardt's name].<$FFFC>
Hey [diehardt's name]!<$FFFE>
It is dawn already. <$FFFC>
The preparation for the knighting ceremony are complete, I assume?<$FFFE>
Yes!<$FFFE>
So you've made it; getting a little nervous right now?<$FFFC>
Haha, that's only natural.<$FFFC>
I was nervous at my knighting ceremony too.<$FFFE>
Lord Geriord.....<$FFFE>
Now that's a bit too formal.<$FFFE>
I am thinking of you as my equal,<$FFFC>
so just call me Geriord as you always do.<$FFFE>
Thank you for everything you have done for me so far.<$FFFC>
Undoubtedly you are the most honourable of the royal knights, Geriord.<$FFFE>
Haha!<$FFFC>
I kinda expect you to go for that title before long. <$FFFE>
I kinda expect you to go for that title before long. <$FFFC>
Well, We shouldn't let everyone waiting.<$FFFE>
Yes!<$FFFE>
...Now I finally will become a knight.<$FFFC>
I have dreamed of this day since I was a little boy....<$FFFE>
Have it really been 6 years since I began my knightly training under Lord William?<$FFFC>
Time sure flies by.<$FFFE>
I wonder how princess Flaire is doing.<$FFFE>
She should be getting 16 years old soon, she must have grown pretty much as well...<$FFFE>
After the knighting ceremony I'm going to pay her visit. <$FFFE>
Mountains near the Floating Castle<$FFFF>
Your Excellency Altemüller.<$FFFE>
We have been infiltrating the castle for 4 days now without making a move. The troops are getting restless...<$FFFE>
There's no need to worry.<$FFFC>
We will act at once.<$FFFE>
That would be unreasonable. There is a storm to come up shortly.<$FFFC>
We cannot fly like this.<$FFFE>
Say, did you ever hear about the Demonic Cannon of this Floating Castle?<$FFFE>
Rumours state that its power alone is enough to annihilate a whole town.<$FFFE>
Indeed.<$FFFC>
This very cannon is the one thing that stays in the way of the Empire's plans to expand. With it gone the castle will fall to the ground like a rock, heralding the glorious rise of the Empire.<$FFFE>
However, in order to conquer the castle one must stay undetected by the castle's guards at all costs.<$FFFE>
So, what you plan is to use the storm clouds as cover?<$FFFE>
Exactly, that's why this unit was made up of only veteran fliers.<$FFFC>
At least flying through the storm is safer than facing the Demonic Cannon, no?<$FFFE>
I consent.<$FFFE>
All units, move out!<$FFFE>
Floating Castle ~ Assembly Hall<$FFFF>
...<$FFFC>
[diehardt's name] Claus.<$FFFC>
Before I grant you the title of a knight, you must make the ceremonial oath.<$FFFE>
...[diehardt's name] Claus.<$FFFC>
Before I grant you the title of a knight, you must make the ceremonial oath.<$FFFE>
After this you are ready, [diehardt's name].<$FFFE>
Yes milord!<$FFFC>
I vow to be pure of heart and renounce the lust for power and fame.<$FFFE>
[diehardt's name],<$FFFC>
from now on you must serve the Larcuss Kingdom honorably.<$FFFE>
Devote yourselves to serving your king and protect those that cannot protect themselves.<$FFFE>
Yessir!<$FFFE>
Congratulations on your investiture.<$FFFE>
Congratulations!<$FFFC>
You've really earned it!<$FFFE>
In celebration of the investiture to the position of knight, a small banquet has been prepared.<$FFFC>
All of you please join us in the banquet hall.<$FFFE>
In the sky nearby the Floating Castle<$FFFF>
...Advance quietly.<$FFFE>
According to our spy they are busy holding a knighting ceremony today.<$FFFC>
It is not unlikely that they are getting drunk by now....<$FFFE>
I'm afraid we'll have to ruin that petty fun of theirs.<$FFFC>
Now let's take this flying eyesore out of the sky!<$FFFE>
Yessir!<$FFFE>
Floating castle banquet hall <$FFFF>
At last you have become a knight. Now you can protect this castle along with Papa and Geriord.<$FFFE>
Sure thing, Tiaris.<$FFFE>
Err....my dear guests!<$FFFC>
Today we not only have one happy occasion to celebrate.<$FFFE>
The word is yours Geriord.<$FFFE>
...Yes...<$FFFE>
I'd like to announce that Layla and myself have decided to get married.<$FFFE>
Ehhhhh!<$FFFC>
Really!?<$FFFE>
It's true. Tiaris.<$FFFE>
Aww, I'm so jealous....<$FFFE>
Due to our regulations, you all are witnesses to the official announcement of the betrothal made today.<$FFFE>
You two make a great couple, everyone knows that already.<$FFFC>
Congratulations Geriord.<$FFFC>
Congratulations Miss Layla.<$FFFE>
Thank you, [diehardt's name].<$FFFE>
Th..the enemy!<$FFFC>
Flying troops of the Rigüler Empire are attacking us! <$FFFE>
!!<$FFFC>
How many are there and where did they appear?<$FFFE>
They number three units and two Commanders, they are approaching from the western skies.<$FFFE>
So few.<$FFFC>
Those surely are not the real threat, they must plan a surprise attack.<$FFFE>
Perhaps approaching from the west side is just a feint. Their intention must be to have us on west side while launching an attack from the east side.<$FFFE>
I agree.<$FFFE>
Everyone, it seems the ceremony has to be adjourned.<$FFFC>
Please hurry and evacuate to the ground.<$FFFE>
Lord William!<$FFFC>
I will fight too!<$FFFE>
In that case you will secure the western side with Tiaris and intercept all approaching enemies.<$FFFC>
This is the first real battle for the two of you,<$FFFC>
so act with utmost caution!<$FFFE>
Geriord and myself will head over to the east side.<$FFFE>
Yessir!<$FFFE>
Geriord...<$FFFE>
Please.....be careful....<$FFFE>
Don't worry, we will be alright.<$FFFE>
Be careful out there, Papa!<$FFFE>
...So [diehardt's name].<$FFFC>
Let's hurry to our side too!<$FFFE>
Right!<$FFFE>
<$FFFF>
