Scenario ~ 21<$FFFC>
"The Magnificent Capitol, Larcussia"<$FFFE>
The mobile force rescued Lord Raymond from the convoy<$FFFC>
of Imperial airships and then hastened to the royal capitol<$FFFC>
of Larcussia to reinforce the decimated troops there.<$FFFE>
They must recapture that place if they wish to have<$FFFC>
restored the Kingdom of Larcuss in both name and truth. <$FFFC>
But, wily General Emaillink stands in their way.<$FFFE>
*Condition for Victory<$FFFC>
 -Destruction of all enemies<$FFFC>
*Condition for Defeat<$FFFC>
 -Death of [diehardt's name]<$FFFE>
Former Larcussia Royal Castle ~ Currently Imperial Headquarters<$FFFF>
Your Excellency!<$FFFC>
That company has defeated the escort for Lord Raymond.<$FFFE>
What did you say?<$FFFE>
.....I see.<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
So they even captured an airship after they defeated Bortz.<$FFFE>
At this rate, they'll probably head here soon.<$FFFD>
What do you think?<$FFFE>
They won't use the airship to come here.<$FFFC>
Because of our encircling airship fleet, they'd be at a disadvantage.<$FFFE>
So, by land.....<$FFFE>
Indeed.<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
Head out, Emaillink.<$FFFD>
Until Geier returns with the aerial fortress, we won't have any further reinforcements.<$FFFC>
Delay their attack as much as you can!<$FFFE>
Sir!<$FFFC>
It shall be as you command.<$FFFE>
Rigüler Empire ~ Supply Base for Larcussia<$FFFF>
W..why......we.....<$FFFE>
Hmmph.<$FFFC>
Show no mercy.<$FFFE>
.....Lord Geier.<$FFFC>
Please, tell us why we're annihilating our comrades in the supply defense corps.<$FFFD>
As things stand, we just can't agree.<$FFFE>
You all will be duly rewarded for your part in this stratagem.<$FFFE>
That's not what we wish, please give us an explanation!<$FFFC>
To us, things like rewards.....<$FFFE>
So you've said.<$FFFC>
You all must not accept everything without question.<$FFFD>
..Oh Spirits of Flame, creator of the ten thousand dharmas.<$FFFC>
Obey our pact, and gather unto me.<$FFFC>
Immolate in flame all those I designate.....<$FFFE>
I..it can't be!<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
G..general!?<$FFFE>
....Burn everything.<$FFFC>
Agnis Egdolans.......<$FFFD>
Now, accept your "reward"!<$FFFE>
Guwaaaaaaaa!<$FFFE>
Guhaa!  Wh.......Gene....Gei.......<$FFFE>
Hohoho,<$FFFD>
....Like I'd really leave anyone living who knew of this incident.<$FFFE>
