It's you!<$FFFC>
...The one who would dare to toy with my daughter's remains!<$FFFE>
Your daughter, you say?<$FFFC>
I'm afraid that evades my memory.<$FFFC>
But I'm a necromancer.<$FFFD>
It is my very profession to make good use of countless of corpses!<$FFFC>
So you'll excuse me for not remembering every single one of them.<$FFFE>
You Bastard!<$FFFC>
Everyone, let me handle this!<$FFFD>

There's an adorable flower blooming in the field before you.<$FFFE>
Do you want to pull it out?<$FFFE>
The flower wilted.<$FFFE>
A beautiful girl appeared from midst of the flower.<$FFFD>

Already...dead...<$FFFE>
Huh?<$FFFE>
Forgive me...<$FFFE>
Goddess Lushiris, grant me the power to smite the loathed demon kind!<$FFFE>
Lushiris...<$FFFE>
GO back to the darkness you came from, demon!<$FFFE>
Gurgh...<$FFFC>
Please look after...my grave..<$FFFE>
Uuhhhg...<$FFFE>
That hurt...<$FFFE>
Keh!<$FFFC>
Where's that pain coming from...<$FFFE>
Guarrgh!?<$FFFC>
How come I can still feel pain...<$FFFD>
I will take my leave for now.<$FFFC>
Continue the onslaught unbridled during my absence!<$FFFE>
Guargh!?<$FFFC>
I see you posses the Haja no Ken, to think I was hoaxed by mere humans...<$FFFD>
For now I'll withdraw.<$FFFC>
But the next time we meet you'll become my obsequious underlings!<$FFFE>

This is getting tiresome.<$FFFD>
I'll take my leave now.<$FFFC>
Continue the onslaught unbridled in my absence!<$FFFE>
Stop right there!<$FFFC>

Humans aren't even good enough to be our food!<$FFFE>
Those who are only relying on Lushiris will perish in the wake of demon ascension.<$FFFE>
Your presumptuousness shall be your downfall!<$FFFE>
GYAAAHH!<$FFFE>
GYAAAHH!<$FFFE>
GUWOOOOHHH!<$FFFE>

Now everyone, come at me!<$FFFE>
There's more up ahead, don't think you'll win that easily.<$FFFE>
Too bad, it seems they were worthless after all!<$FFFC>
Now everyone, come at me!<$FFFE>
Uwaaah!<$FFFE>

Uwaah!<$FFFC>

W..Why do I have to die like this...<$FFFE>
Please!<$FFFC>

Mother!<$FFFE>

Oh but I just love seeing you miserable humans die.<$FFFC>
It is my greatest pleasure in life.<$FFFE>
No!<$FFFE>
Aaahh...<$FFFC>
How could this happen!?<$FFFE>
Sir Diehärte!<$FFFC>
The villagers...<$FFFE>
Blasted!<$FFFC>
We couldn't save them...<$FFFE>
Sir Diehärte.<$FFFC>
The villagers are safe now.<$FFFE>
Good.<$FFFC>
I'm glad we made it in time.<$FFFE>
Concerning the villagers safety...<$FFFC>
We weren't in time to save all.<$FFFE>
You commanded us flawlessly.<$FFFE>
You commanded us lousily.<$FFFD>
I speak for all of us when I'm saying...<$FFFC>

We will pray for your success on the battlefield.<$FFFE>
Well then, let's return to the capitol!<$FFFE>
Deceased ones raise again, do my biding and haunt the living!<$FFFD>
Mihari han kimojinihi kushizekiki iyokana hagujisoramu!<$FFFE>
What!<$FFFC>
Walking Corpses!?<$FFFE>
Who do you think your dealing with?<$FFFC>
Grove the necromancer isn't someone to mess around with.<$FFFE>
Necromancer Grove,...You'll pay dearly for this!<$FFFE>
Grove, your evil deeds end here!<$FFFE>
All I'm doing is giving those corpses another purpose to live.<$FFFC>
What is so bad about this?<$FFFE>
To disturb the rest of the deceased like this is the most blasphemous behavior!<$FFFE>
I cannot understand.<$FFFC>
Such hate, instead of being grateful to me for offering life renewed.<$FFFE>
Silence!<$FFFE>
