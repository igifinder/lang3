Scenario ~ 13<$FFFC>
"To Hunt a Holy Beast"<$FFFE>
[diehardt's name]'s mobile division, now bolstered by the addition<$FFFC>
of Sage Fauvel, Sophia's father and warden of the eastern gate,<$FFFC>
heads towards the western gate, leaving the liberation of the<$FFFC>
northern gate to Raymond's army.<$FFFE>
It turns out that the warden of this gate is not human. However, by<$FFFC>
the time the party arrives at the western gate, Ruud and the<$FFFC>
Barral army, following the orders of the Dark Knight, have already<$FFFC>
laid siege to it.<$FFFE>
*Condition for Victory<$FFFC>
 -Complete annihilation of enemies<$FFFC>
*Conditions for Defeat<$FFFC>
 -Death of [diehardt's name]<$FFFC>
 -Death of Jügler<$FFFE>
City of Laffel - Currently Occupied by Barral<$FFFF>
Lord Geier!<$FFFC>
Four ships, now six, now seven have been shot out the sky!<$FFFC>
If things continue like this....<$FFFE>
Grrrrrr......<$FFFC>
..<$fe><$28>..<$fe><$f>Re<$fe><$f..<$fe><$f>treat<$fe><$f>.....<$FFFE>
Send a message to the remaining ships!<$FFFC>
All units are to retreat!<$FFFE>
Yes, sir!<$FFFE>
Shit!<$FFFC>
Damn you, Dark Knight!<$FFFC>
Try to sink MY ship will you!<$FFFE>
....I'll remember this day!<$FFFC>
You'll come to rue the day you humiliated me so, I swear it!<$FFFE>
Lushiris Gate ~ Northern Gate<$FFFF>
That general called Bortz was quite an admirable man, in spite of being our enemy.<$FFFE>
Indeed.<$FFFD>
Such true heroism, to come against us, alone so that his subordinates could escape.<$FFFD>
I'd welcome a chance to fight against him again somewhere.<$FFFE>
....I've opened the gate, but the power to ward away demons hasn't been revived!<$FFFE>
Oh, is that not because only three of the gates have been opened?<$FFFE>
It must be so.<$FFFD>
Speaking of which, I've received a report that [diehardt's name] and company have headed to the western gate.<$FFFE>
Then, how shall we proceed?<$FFFE>
Hmm.<$FFFE>
Once Diehärte and company have opened the final gate, we should seek Lady Jessica out again, so we can quickly finalize the renewal of the Lushiris Gate.<$FFFE>
As you wish.<$FFFC>
I shall go and inform the soldiers.<$FFFE>
If you will pardon me.<$FFFE>
Lewin and [diehardt's name] have done far more than I had thought possible.<$FFFD>
.....They've become quite a potent force.<$FFFE>
