During [diehardt's name]'s Division's Preparations<$FFFF>
How are the preparations for this campaign going, Luna?<$FFFE>
Well.<$FFFC>
Pretty soon, most of our preparations will be complete.<$FFFD>
The clock's ticking, so we'd best leave as soon as we can.<$FFFE>
At long last we'll be attacking Velzeria.<$FFFE>
I wonder if  victory will be ours.....<$FFFE>
Hey now, the King shouldn't worry about this kind of thing.<$FFFD>
It'll all work out.<$FFFC>
After all, King Sieghart will be with us as the Langrisser.<$FFFD>
And I'll be there too.<$FFFE>
That's right.<$FFFC>
Lewin, we're all here for you!<$FFFE>
Thanks a lot, everyone.<$FFFE>
Bad news!<$FFFD>
Someone has poisoned the  Imperial Field Marshal, Sir Altemüller!<$FFFE>
Say what!<$FFFE>
It seems they haven't been able to catch the murderer yet.....<$FFFE>
Altemüller.....<$FFFB>
<$FFFC>
That man.....<$FFFE>
RigEer Imperial Castle - Audience Room<$FFFF>
I see, so someone's killed that damned Altemüller, eh.<$FFFE>
Yes, milord.<$FFFE>
How kind of someone to spare us all the trouble of doing it ourselves.<$FFFE>
First Father died before his time, and now that pesky Altemüller is out of the way too.<$FFFC>
That means the Empire is mine!<$FFFE>
Hohohohoho....!<$FFFE>
Velzeria Castle<$FFFF>
The assassination of Altemüller went off without a hitch.<$FFFE>
Hmm, I see. Well done.<$FFFE>
My humble apologies, Lord Böser.<$FFFC>
My attempted conquest of Elthlead has failed.<$FFFE>
Since the Haja no Ken turned out to have more power against demons than I'd expected, our power was....<$FFFE>
...That's fine.<$FFFC>
Now that Rag is dead, you'll need to work harder, though.<$FFFE>
Now that the Field Marshal who was responsible for much of the military strength of the Empire is gone, things should be easier.<$FFFE>
Altemüller!?<$FFFE>
Then, that Varna woman....?<$FFFE>
Exactly.<$FFFC>
It seems that threatening her beloved younger sister was enough to decide the issue for her.<$FFFE>
It's such sentiment which make humans the most foolish living things.<$FFFE>
Such an interesting strategy Grove thought up, to use that against her.<$FFFE>
Speaking of Varna, how shall we dispose of her younger sister?<$FFFE>
Interesting question.<$FFFC>
We can still use that Varna woman.<$FFFE>
So, we'll let the younger sister live a little longer, to further our ambitions.<$FFFE>
