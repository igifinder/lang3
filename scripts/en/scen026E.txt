What is it that you want!?<$FFFE>
Hihihihi!<$FFFC>
We are here by order of our lord Böser, we have come to claim your life.<$FFFE>
My life?<$FFFC>
Why is it that you wish me dead?<$FFFE>
As far as we know, you are the only one who can enhance the power of the Haja no Ken.<$FFFE>
Of course we couldn't allow that sword to become more powerful than Alhazard.<$FFFE>
If you are wiped from the face of this world, Velzerias triumph would be a certainty.<$FFFE>
...Wicked Demons!<$FFFE>
Well then, my pets!<$FFFC>
Break into his house and kill him for good.<$FFFE>
Yes, master!<$FFFE>
Master Rag, the door won't budge!<$FFFE>
Use your head for once!<$FFFC>
Naturally you have to use powerful destructive magic to open it!<$FFFE>
Understood.<$FFFE>
Uwaaah!<$FFFC>
Demons are attacking!<$FFFE>
It would seem as if the demons are also aware of his ability to strengthen the Haja no Ken.<$FFFE>
Pfft!<$FFFC>
Elthlied forces have come.<$FFFC>
We have to get over with this fast.<$FFFE>
We should advance with utmost haste, if we wish for  Olver to live.<<$FFFE>
You there, tear that door apart right now!<$FFFE>
Yessir!<$FFFE>
Everyone else, move out to destroy the Elthlied forces!<$FFFE>
GAAAAAAHHHH!<$FFFE>
You're way too rusty and shrivelled to keep up with us, you ugly geezer!<$FFFE>
Hihihihi!<$FFFC>
Such a vigorous lass!<$FFFD>
Shortly you'll understand what mere children you all are before our power!<$FFFE>
Commence the Attack!<$FFFC>
Above all we must ensure Olver's safety!<$FFFE>
Well, please tell me what I should do from here on.<$FFFE>
What are your orders for Olver?<$FFFE>
Wait inside the house<$FFFE>
Move to the south<$FFFE>
Please wait inside the house.<$FFFE>
Certainly.<$FFFE>
Please evacuate to the south.<$FFFC>
We will guard you!<$FFFE>
Thank you kindly.<$FFFE>
Now then, get that door open pronto!<$FFFE>
Yessir!<$FFFE>
What's that!?<$FFFC>
They found a way to break through my door...<$FFFE>
Hahaha...<$FFFC>
The gate was broken!<$FFFC>
That's what you get for messing with me!<$FFFE>
That's bad!<$FFFC>
We need to hurry!<$FFFE>
Only one door remains!<$FFFC>
Take care of it before those humans get a chance to interfere!<$FFFE>
Yes, sir!<$FFFE>
Hmph!<$FFFC>
How dare you mock me!<$FFFE>
What a stubborn door...<$FFFC>
Let's see how you like what I got in store for you next!<$FFFE>
What, the door withstood my magic?<$FFFE>
Aaah!<$FFFC>
If they keep it up they'll probably break through the door before long!<$FFFE>
Quickly!<$FFFE>
Hahahahaha!<$FFFC>
At long last!<$FFFC>
Give in to your fate!<$FFFE>
What is the meaning of this?<$FFFC>
If I must I'll resist to my last breath!<$FFFE>
Bad news!<$FFFC>
If Olver is killed, it becomes will be to enhance the Haja no Ken!<$FFFE>
That door,<$FFFC>
it won't hold for much longer...<$FFFE>
Sir Diehärte, if we don't act this instant...<$FFFE>
There is no time!<$FFFC>
Everyone, on the double!<$FFFE>
Hahaha...<$FFFC>
The prey has been cornered, I can't wait to savour the sweet taste of spilled blood already!<$FFFE>
Sir Diehärte, there's not much time left!<$FFFC>
If that door is destroyed too, we'll have a major problem to deal with.<$FFFE>
I know...<$FFFE>
Finally the gate has fallen!<$FFFE>
Well...<$FFFC>
Should I open the door and come out?<$FFFE>
Well...<$FFFC>
Should I open the second door now?<$FFFE>
Well...<$FFFC>
Should I open the door?<$FFFE>
Well...<$FFFC>
Should I open the second door now?<$FFFE>
Well...<$FFFC>
Should I open the door?<$FFFE>
Well...<$FFFC>
Should I open the door?<$FFFE>
Huff, I'm too old for this...<$FFFE>
Sir Diehärte.<$FFFC>
Olver has been successfully evacuated.<$FFFE>
Alright, let's sweep up the remaining enemies!<$FFFE>
On a spot of bare land, an axe with runic symbols on it is stuck to the ground.<$FFFC>
When you reached out for the Axe a voice spoke from somewhere.<$FFFD>
"What is it you rely most on in battle?"<$FFFE>
What do you answer?<$FFFE>
Courage<$FFFE>
Faith<$FFFE>
Physical strength<$FFFE>
"In that case you have no need for our power."<$FFFD>
The voice went silent and the Axe was swallowed by the ground...<$FFFE>
"In that case you have no need for our power."<$FFFD>
The voice went silent and the Axe was swallowed by the ground...<$FFFE>
"If it is power you seek, receive this as our gift."<$FFFE>
Rune Axe was obtained!<$FFFE>
Maggots!<$FFFC>
Use the teleport spell to get to him!<$FFFE>
We'll take care of the enemy!<$FFFC>
Please hurry and evacuate to the south!<$FFFE>
Very well.<$FFFC>
I'll try to hurry those old bones.<$FFFE>
Don't let him get away!<$FFFC>
Kill that geezer no matter what!<$FFFE>
I'm sorry everyone....<$FFFE>
Diehärte...<$FFFE>
My power wasn't enough...<$FFFE>
Tis is all I can do...<$FFFE>
Just keep going...<$FFFE>
Huh?<$FFFE>
Forgive me...<$FFFE>
Aah, what beautiful light...<$FFFE>
This can't be happening...<$FFFE>
Uuhg...<$FFFE>
Why...<$FFFE>
What a fail!<$FFFC>
I'm sorry, Diehärte!<$FFFE>
This is the end....<$FFFE>
Master Olver!<$FFFE>
Curses!FFFC>
We couldn't save him!<$FFFE>
Hahaha!<$FFFC>
Hmm, that went rather well.<$FFFC>
All troop, retreat!<$FFFE>
That's just a scratch...<$FFFD>
Most importantly is that we fulfilled our duty.<$FFFC>
I'm fine.<$FFFD>
Don't let this be a cause of worry for you.<$FFFC>
Enjoy the short time you still have left.<$FFFD>
Hehehehe...<$FFFE>
What a stubborn old man!<$FFFE>
Uuurgh...<$FFFC>
You did unexpectedly well.<$FFFE>
Are you alright master Olvar!?<$FFFE>
I'm fine.<$FFFC>
Still more demons are approaching!<$FFFE>
This is bad.<$FFFC>
We have to protect him no matter what!<$FFFE>
W..What...!?<$FFFC>
I..can't die..like this...<$FFFE>
Hmph....<$FFFC>
Even though..my body is shattered..Master Böser..will..Urghh!<$FFFE>
But it's fine.<$FFFC>
...My pets, run wild as much as you want...<$FFFC>
Enjoy yourselves in my stead...Uarrgh!<$FFFE>
Rag is done for....<$FFFC>
But the demons haven't stopped their rampage!<$FFFE>
Sir Diehärte, there are still demons that threaten Olver's live.<$FFFE>
Also we should purge them all, or they may cause trouble in villages around.<$FFFE>
You're right we cannot allow even one of them to escape.<$FFFC>
Wipe out every single one of them!<$FFFE>
How typically human to be conceited beyond limits!<$FFFD>
Come and get a little taste of the superior power of us demons!<$FFFE>
Hahaha!<$FFFC>
It's time for your lifeforce to be harvested!<$FFFE>
Guwaaah!<$FFFE>
Well, it seems they got some wits after all.<$FFFC>
Those obnoxious kids from Elthlied!<$FFFE>
What!?<$FFFC>
The enemy is targeting us!<$FFFE>
There's no escaping us!<$FFFC>
Run as far as you want!<$FFFE>
What happened to my beautiful face!!?<$FFFE>
In such a place...<$FFFE>
God of chaos!<$FFFC>
Bring us salvation!<$FFFE>
GYAAAA!<$FFFE>
GYAAAA!<$FFFE>
Magical...<$FFFE>
Chaos-Sama!<$FFFE>
Resistance is futile...<$FFFD>
Urggh!<$FFFE>
GYAAAA!<$FFFE>
GYAAAA!<$FFFE>
GOOON!<$FFFE>
Defeated by such inferior beings...<$FFFE>
Why I am defeated!?<$FFFE>
That's death...?<$FFFE>
GYAAAA!<$FFFE>
GOOON!<$FFFE>
GOOON!<$FFFE>
KISYAAAA!<$FFFE>
KISYAAAA!<$FFFE>
Now only Rag is left!<$FFFE>
It's over.<$FFFE>
Do you want Olver to open his door?<$FFFE>
It is too dangerous right now to open it.<$FFFC>
Please wait for a little while longer.<$FFFE>
Alright.<$FFFE>
Do you want Olver to open his door?<$FFFE>
Please do.<$FFFE>
Alright, just give me a minute!<$FFFE>
Please wait until we have secured the area.<$FFFE>
Certainly.<$FFFE>
Please do.<$FFFE>
Alright, just give me a minute!<$FFFE>
Huh?<$FFFE>
H..How did you break it with one blow?<$FFFE>
Now now, that wasn't too much of an effort.<$FFFD>
You see, this door was especially constructed to ward of demons.<$FFFE>

Sir Diehärte, I'm happy to serve under such a capable commander.<$FFFE>
Sir Diehärte...<$FFFC>
I'm growing tired lecturing you for your lack of skill...<$FFFD>
Do you even try to take your job seriously?<$FFFE>
Now then, let us hurry back to Sieghart and the others.<$FFFE>
Are you the one called Olver?<$FFFE>
Indeed, may I inquire what business you have with me?<$FFFE>
We are here on behalf of lady Jessica.<$FFFE>
Lady Jessica, you say.<$FFFC>
...I see.<$FFFC>
In that case it is my pleasure to make your acquaintance.<$FFFE>
<$FFFF>
