Elthlied's Royal Capitol, Larcussia ~ Audience Hall<$FFFF>
For now, we of Elthlied and the Rigüler Empire shall agree to a cease-fire until the defeat of Velzeria.<$FFFE>
Elthlied has barely even been established as a country.<$FFFC>
Right now we'd rather focus our efforts on settling our internal affairs than on fighting.<$FFFE>
We of the Empire are in the same boat.<$FFFC>
These monsters of Velzeria have even dared to invade the Empire.<$FFFE>
And with the recent death of our Emperor, the administration is in a state of instability.<$FFFC>
So, neither of us have the luxury of ignoring this mutual problem posed by Velzeria.<$FFFE>
As things stand now, it is mutually beneficial to formalize this truce.<$FFFE>
With that done, I bid you farewell.<$FFFE>
........<$FFFE>
What's wrong, Tiaris?<$FFFE>
Say, [diehardt's name].<$FFFE>
Do you approve of allying with that guy?<$FFFE>
Oh, that's what's bothering you.<$FFFE>
I think it's a good thing that we don't have to fight both Velzeria and the Empire at the same time.<$FFFE>
....I guess so.<$FFFE>
If it's okay for you, I think I can live with it too.<$FFFE>
Tiaris.....<$FFFE>
....I just can't believe it.<$FFFC>
That guy...killed Father....<$FFFE>
Tiaris....<$FFFE>
King Sieghart, Lady Jessica has arrived.<$FFFE>
Lady Jessica?<$FFFD>
Send her right in.<$FFFE>
Yes, sir!<$FFFE>
My, my, Lady Jessica.<$FFFC>
You are quite a sight for sore eyes.<$FFFE>
I have thought of a plan to strike against Velzeria.<$FFFE>
Many thanks for your efforts.<$FFFE>
By using the power of the demon sword, the Alhazard, Böser has amplified his powers of darkness and been able to negate the power of the Lushiris Gate.<$FFFD>
We must obtain the power to overcome the demon blade, the Alhazard.<$FFFE>
Is the Haja no Ken not sufficient?<$FFFE>
Of course, the Haja no Ken is important.<$FFFD>
However, we can't overcome the Alhazard with just the power of the Haja no Ken.<$FFFE>
So the Alhazard is that powerful....<$FFFE>
To strengthen the power of the Haja no Ken, we need to secure the cooperation of a certain person.<$FFFD>
Please, help me escort this person to the center of the Lushiris Gate.<$FFFE>
I hate to ask this, but could I once more depend on you all?<$FFFE>
Of course.<$FFFE>
Velzeria Castle<$FFFF>
I can't believe this turn of events.<$FFFC>
Altemüller's very existence has become a hindrance to our plans.<$FFFE>
Grove!<$FFFC>
Hurry up the assassination of this pest!<$FFFE>
Yes, my lord!<$FFFE>
Now, what to do about Elthlied....<$FFFE>
Lord Böser, please let me deal with Elthlied.<$FFFE>
Ferakia...<$FFFC>
Very well, I shall leave it to you.<$FFFE>
<$FFFF>
