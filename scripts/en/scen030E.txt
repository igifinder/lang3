Velzerian Castle ~ Underground<$FFFF>
Hmm, it would seem that Ferakia and Grove are finished for now as well.<$FFFE>
You're Böser!<$FFFE>
Indeed. My name shall be Böser.<$FFFC>
As it is for all Velzerian kings and successors to the Demon Sword Alhazard. <$FFFE>
Although humans may know me as,<$FFFC>
the Prince of darkness.<$FFFE>
You were the one responsible for the destruction of my homeland!<$FFFE>
Hahaha, so it would seem.<$FFFC>
Certainly, it was quiet a pleasure all those years back, my what good fun.<$FFFE>
Fun!?<$FFFE>
Precisely.<$FFFC>
I can hardly think of anything more entertaining than destroying some petty humans.<$FFFD>
And who would care about that backwater eastern village in the first place.<$FFFE>
Uuaarrgh, you'll pay for this Böser!<$FFFE>
Everyone, let us be as one and smite the archfiend of humanity!<$FFFC>
We cannot allow him have his way with this world and endanger the peace so many gave their lives for!<$FFFE>
Well said!<$FFFC>
If you like it or not, you'll soon realize the power humans posses, Böser!<$FFFE>
Muhahaha, now fathom the unmatchable power of Alhazard!<$FFFE>
As the successors of Alhazard, by the name of Böser, I command you to take shape!<$FFFE>
That can't be!<$FFFC>
Just a moment ago there was no demonic presence at all!<$FFFE>
It seems that they were hidden somehow.<$FFFE>
He summoned an Arch demon and a Bahamut.<$FFFC>
Only to summon all those lesser minions is beyond difficult, good heavens.<$FFFE>
Not only that but he just summoned all those with one simple incantation. <$FFFE>
This is the terrible might of Alhazard.<$FFFE>
The one who wields Alhazard becomes King of all Demons.<$FFFE>
All demons have unyielding loyalty to their Lord and will bid his every command.<$FFFC>
It is said Alhazard's powers to control the demon kind are infinite.<$FFFE>
Hoho.<$FFFC>
That women knows an awful lot about the demon sword.$FFFC>
I guess one could expect as much from the Avatar of Lushiris.<$FFFE>
But after all your annoyance will end too once you are dead.<$FFFE>
You will soon regret underestimating us, Böser.<$FFFC>
By Lushiris sacred name I vow to defeat you.<$FFFC>
For such is my holy mission.<$FFFE>
Hmph.<$FFFC>
At the moment you are nothing but a fragile bag of flesh, offshoot of Lushiris.<$FFFC>
Such is not to be feared by the likes of myself.<$FFFE>
Now, let the bloody festivities begin!<$FFFE>
Threatening the hostage's life was your last hope for escaping your fate.<$FFFD>
Give up Böser.<$FFFE>
Ridiculous, there is nothing you lowly humans can do to me!<$FFFC>
Shortly you shall feel my mortal wrath for your insolence!<$FFFE>
Oh...<$FFFC>
Be my guest.<$FFFE>
Sister!<$FFFE>
Anna!<$FFFC>
Hold out a little while longer!<$FFFC>
Help is on the way!<$FFFE>
Please stop!<$FFFC>
Don't hurt my big sister!<$FFFE>
Hehehehe...<$FFFC>
If she decides to turn against me she chooses certain death.<$FFFD>
Humans are such brainless creatures...<$FFFE>
Hmph!<$FFFC>
You won't be so full of yourself for long!<$FFFE>
Kill them all!<$FFFE>
GYAAAA!<$FFFE>
Surrond them!<$FFFE>
SYAAAA!<$FFFE>
The price for ridiculing me,<$FFFC>
is paid in blood!<$FFFE>
What wasteful struggle...<$FFFE>
Show those foolish humans the power of darkness!<$FFFC>
Move out!<$FFFE>
GA!<$FFFE>
As you look into the hole, a floating feather comes into sight.<$FFFC>
But it's to far away to be reached with your hands alone.<$FFFE>
What do you do?<$FFFE>
Try to reach it with your weapon.<$FFFE>
Jump into the hole.<$FFFE>
Breath at the feather.<$FFFE>
As soon as your weapon touches the feather it turns to dust....<$FFFE>
You jump into the hole and grasp the feather your body is lifted back to the ground by the feather's magic.<$FFFE>
Heavenly Wings were obtained!<$FFFE>
Your breath throws the feather off to an unreachable distance.<$FFFE>
While inspecting the hole you notice a large floating egg.<$FFFE>
Do you take the egg?<$FFFE>
You succeeded in getting the egg.<$FFFE>
What do you do with it?<$FFFE>
Eat it.<$FFFE>
Try to open it.<$FFFE>
Put it away carefully.<$FFFE>
<$f6>protection<$fc> Strength rises +1<$FFFE>
W<$FFFE>
The Ancient Egg was obtained!<$FFFE>
The egg keeps sinking to the bottom of the whole gently.<$FFFE>
Your last hour has come, Böser!<$FFFC>
You have no hope of victory!<$FFFE>
Nonsense!<$FFFC>
Pathetic Insects!<$FFFD>
You humans shall perish and the reign of demon will dawn upon this world!<$FFFE>
That day will never come!<$FFFE>
To die...in the final battle...<$FFFE>
I still can...<$FFFE>
Father...<$FFFE>
Coty...<$FFFE>
Sorry, everyone...<$FFFC>
So tired...<$FFFE>
Oh...<$FFFE>
Sir, Diehärte...<$FFFE>
Ahh, that light....<$FFFE>
Sophia...<$FFFE>
Guuugh...<$FFFE>
I've failed!<$FFFE>
This could have been avoided....<$FFFE>
Oh, the blue sky....<$FFFE>
I have no regrets...<$FFFE>
For the sake of every human in this world, I will destroy you!<$FFFC>
Prepare yourself Böser!<$FFFE>
Hohoho!<$FFFC>
Come, taste the bitter suffering of the powerless!<$FFFC>
I'll teach you a lesson in pain unimaginable!<$FFFE>
This is absurd!?<$FFFE>
W-where do you take that strength from?<$FFFD>
The power of humans should be inferior to our own...<$FFFC>
Hohoho...<$FFFE>
Damn you, Böser!<$FFFC>
I won't allow this!<$FFFE>
Hmph.<$FFFC>
I couldn't allow myself to die just yet.<$FFFE>
Return Anna as you promised or suffer the consequences.<$FFFD>
For the sake of Varna I can overcome everything, even death can't stop me!<$FFFE>
This castle will be your grave!<$FFFC>
Only when you are dead, will this world breath freely!<$FFFE>
Hahaha.<$FFFC>
Do you want to taste Alhazard's power?<$FFFE>
Anna...<$FFFE>
Big Sis!<$FFFE>
Trust me....help will be here every minute now.<$FFFD>
I won't abandon you till my last breath...<$FFFE>
You're such a nuisance!<$FFFE>
Böser!<$FFFC>
Prepare yourself!<$FFFE>
Such mockery...<$FFFC>
I..I'm the successors of AlHazard...this can't...<$FFFE>
Alhazard was obtained!<$FFFE>
Today's victory makes me proud to be part of your unit [diehardt's name].<$FFFE>
Sir Diehärte...<$FFFC>
I'm just glad we did it somehow...<$FFFD>
But it could have gone better...<$FFFE>
Your Excellency!<$FFFE>
You have done unexpectedly well, Diehärte.<$FFFC>
It seems my help wasn't needed after all.<$FFFE>
Altemüller?<$FFFC>
So you were alive after all?<$FFFE>
Of course.<$FFFD>
But more importantly is Varna's sister safe<$FFFE>
She is safe.<$FFFE>
Your Excellency and you too [diehardt's name], I thank you from the bottom of my heart...<$FFFE>
Anna are you hurt?<$FFFE>
You have my eternal gratitude lord Altemüller.<$FFFE>
Thank you.<$FFFC>
Only due to everyone's combined efforts that nobody died.<$FFFE>
This should put an end to Velzeria's ambitions as well.<$FFFD>
For a while demon invading shouldn't be a threat.<$FFFE>
So this is the power of Alhazard?<$FFFE>
This overwhelming power must come from Alhazard...<$FFFE>
I cannot win against such might.<$FFFE>
GUGAAAAAA!<$FFFE>
Master Böser.....<$FFFE>
Urggh!<$FFFE>
Lord Chaos...<$FFFC>
Lift up the soul from my body...<$FFFE>
Guaaaargh!<$FFFE>
After coming so far...<$FFFE>
Not a grain of power is left within me...<$FFFE>
GAAAAH!<$FFFE>
GAAAAAH!<$FFFE>
GAAAARR!<$FFFE>
GRRAAAAH!<$FFFE>
I had so high expectations for myself....<$FFFE>
You brutes...<$FFFE>
This gotta be a lie...<$FFFC>
This is the end of a fulfilled life...<$FFFE>
Guargh!<$FFFE>
FUUU!<$FFFE>
Aaah...<$FFFC>
It's hopeless...<$FFFE>
Bastards...<$FFFE>
FUUU!<$FFFE>
GOOON!<$FFFE>
GISYAAA!<$FFFE>
GISYAAA!<$FFFE>
GOOON!<$FFFE>
You miserable humans, all your struggling is in vain.<$FFFC>
Now you shall realize your complete helplessness!<$FFFE>
Kyaah!<$FFFC>
Big....Sis....<$FFFE>
Anna!!<$FFFE>
Kyaaaaaah!<$FFFE>
Hohoho!<$FFFC>
AHAHAHAAHA!<$FFFE>
Curse you, Böser!<$FFFE>
Argh, we couldn't save her....<$FFFE>
Finally I found you, Böser!<$FFFE>
Varna?<$FFFE>
Return my little sister Anna to me!<$FFFE>
Oho if it isn't the perpetrator that disposed of that nuisance Altemuller.<$FFFE>
What?<$FFFE>
Silence!<$FFFC>
You promised to release Anna!<$FFFE>
Well if you want to see her so badly.<$FFFC>
Here she is!<$FFFE>
S..Sister!<$FFFE>
A..Anna!<$FFFD>
....Böser!<$FFFC>
Release Anna!<$FFFE>
Foolish Woman.<$FFFC>
Did you really believe a promise to a lowly human would have any meaning to me?!<$FFFE>
Damn you!<$FFFC>
...Böser!<$FFFE>
So her little sister was taken hostage.<$FFFE>
And for the sake of her Altemüller was....<$FFFE>
It seems like she was threatened into killing Altemüller....<$FFFE>
Being all alone without any relatives is a cruel fate.<$FFFE>
....We have to help her.<$FFFC>
Varna's Sister mustn't be allowed to become another of Böser's victims, like Altemüller.<$FFFE>
Truer words have never been spoken!<$FFFE>
Using blood relatives to further your ends...<$FFFC>
You won't get away with this, Böser!<$FFFE>
Excellent, simply Excellent!<$FFFC>
Let all those dark sentiments flow right into Alhazard!<$FFFE>
So you've come this far.<$FFFC>
As one would expect from those who bested my three demon commanders.<$FFFE>
However, don't forget about my little trump card right here.<$FFFE>
!?<$FFFE>
Will you continue to oppose me even if this girl's life is on the line?<$FFFE>
S..Sister....<$FFFE>
Anna!<$FFFE>
Dammit, he is using her as a human shield.<$FFFE>
Worry not.<$FFFE>
Who said that!?<$FFFE>
It seems like I was in time.<$FFFE>
Your Excellency!<$FFFE>
H..how can this be...Varna should've killed you...<$FFFE>
Varna!<$FFFC>
You double crossed me!<$FFFE>
No, you were just too deluded to notice.<$FFFC>
Prepare yourself, Böser!<$FFFE>
Altemüller?<$FFFC>
How is it possible that you're still alive?<$FFFE>
Let's save the details for later.<$FFFC>
For now concentrate on finishing this battle!<$FFFE>
Now Böser you can't hide behind your hostage anymore!<$FFFE>
....Huhuhuwahahahaa!<$FFFC>
Don't forget that I hold the almighty Alhazard in my hands!<$FFFE>
It seems you are obsessed with power to the bitter end.<$FFFC>
...such foolishness.<$FFFE>
Father!?<$FFFE>
Employing the holy power I'm imbued with, I hereby seal away the demonic powers of Alhazard.<$FFFE>
What...Alhazard's power is fading...<$FFFE>
Now!<$FFFC>
Bring him down with one quick sweep!<$FFFE>
<$FFFF>
