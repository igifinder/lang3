Death of Diehärte<$FFFC>
Death of Sieghart<$FFFE>
In front of Elthlied's Capitol, Larcussia<$FFFF>
So I've returned, this time I won't falter...<$FFFD>
The downfall of Elthlead is already inevitable.<$FFFC>
Now there's just one more thing to do...<$FFFE>
Your Excellency, the line-up of our troops has been completed.<$FFFE>
Good.<$FFFE>
Lord Raymond, no King Sieghart.<$FFFC>
It is time to make up for the humiliation I suffered the last time.<$FFFE>
I assume you are well-prepared for the following?<$FFFE>
Tell me, what is it that makes the Empire craving for our lands so much?<$FFFE>
King Sieghart.<$FFFC>
I assume you can't know the situation the Empire faces?<$FFFE>
We are proud of the size the Empire has grown into.<$FFFC>
Within our borders people can live safely and peacefully.<$FFFE>
However, the majority of our land is frozen wasteland on which no crop will grow.<$FFFE>
And peace alone cannot quench the hunger of so many.<$FFFE>
That's why, for the well-being of our own people, we have to claim more fertile lands.<$FFFE>
If that is the case, wouldn't it be possible to trade in food with the mineral resources of your country?<$FFFE>
Sooner or later such as mineral resources run out.<$FFFE>
We would have food for a short period but the population soon would increase to its maximum and the stocks dwindle.<$FFFE>
Invading your fertile lands is the only substantial way to solve this dilemma.<$FFFE>
While what you say sounds reasonable, incinerating war always is something horrible.<$FFFE>
You who live in these rich lands couldn't fully understand.<$FFFE>
You and me both don't wish to wage war.<$FFFE>
But I cannot abandon the people of the country my father build and protected with his own hands.<$FFFE>
This may be the death of both of us.<$FFFE>
But I'm the king of this country.<$FFFC>
Protecting those who live in it is my foremost duty.<$FFFE>
To an honorable end!<$FFFE>
I couldn't have said it better.<$FFFE>
We're in time!<$FFFE>
Your Excellency, enemy reinforcements have arrived!<$FFFE>
Those most be units returning from an expedition.<$FFFE>
I suppose they are still fatigued from their last mission.<$FFFC>
We will carry out our strategy according to plan.<$FFFE>
Varna, you'll take some troops and smite the ones that just arrived.<$FFFE>
Understood.<$FFFE>
Sir Diehärte, it seems like the enemy has split their troops in two.<$FFFE>
Meaning that we took some pressure from the ongoing siege.<$FFFC>
If we hurry, I think we could actually win this.<$FFFE>
But if the enemy manages to cross that bridge surely the capitol will fall.<$FFFE>
Yeah, simply because we were in time doesn't mean that you can relax just now!<$FFFE>
That's right.<$FFFE>
Everyone, I know your tired but let's give it our all!<$FFFE>
Now our victory over Elthlied is just one step ahead...<$FFFE>
Isn't that the much rumored-about Diehärte?<$FFFC>
As you know Bortz and Emaillink had a hard time dealing with him, do be careful.<$FFFD>
That Diehärte.<$FFFC>
His timing is pretty good.<$FFFE>
Cavalry move out to crush the enemy at the rear.<$FFFC>
Flying units back us up.<$FFFE>
Understood.<$FFFE>
Affirmative.<$FFFE>
Well then, let's get rid of those nuisances.<$FFFC>
Commence the attack on the abominations of Velzerian!<$FFFE>
All troops, follow his Excellency into battle!<$FFFE>
This is not the time for petty quarrels!<$FFFC>
Protect this world which is home to all humans alike!<$FFFE>
Everyone drive back the demons!<$FFFE>
Move out, Varna!<$FFFE>
Yessir!<$FFFE>
Attack!<$FFFC>
Concentrate on throwing down Sieghart!<$FFFE>
The enemy is trying to break through!<$FFFC>
Hold your ground!<$FFFE>
Prepare yourself, Sieghart!<$FFFC>
Today nothing will stand in the way of my victory!<$FFFE>
Don't think you can take me out that easily!<$FFFE>
On top of a mountain a plateau with a small forest was situated.<$FFFD>
One of the trees was much larger than the others.<$FFFC>
An arrow was stuck deeply within it.<$FFFE>
What do you do?<$FFFE>
Cut out the arrow<$FFFE>
Pull out the arrow<$FFFE>
Break off the arrow<$FFFE>
Using an edged tool, you cut out the arrow carefully.<$FFFE>
Obtained Destiny Arrow!<$FFFE>
Upon trying to pull it out, the arrow broke midway.<$FFFE>
With a sluggish sound, the arrow broke.<$FFFE>
We were...<$FFFC>
So close....<$FFFE>
Sir Diehärte?<$FFFC>
Don't die, your powers are still needed!<$FFFE>
Sir Diehärte?<$FFFC>
Don't die, your powers are still needed!<$FFFE>
Father...<$FFFE>
Everyone I'm sorry...<$FFFE>
.....<$FFFE>
Resistance is futile...<$FFFE>
Huch?<$FFFE>
Sorry...<$FFFE>
Lushiris...<$FFFE>
Guu...<$FFFC>
Fare well...<$FFFE>
Urgh!<$FFFE>
What are you doing...<$FFFE>
Keh!<$FFFC>
I can't fail now!<$FFFE>
Uuhg!<$FFFC>
If..I..can't protect...this country...<$FFFE>
Father...<$FFFE>
King Sieghart...<$FFFE>
Don't let a single demon set foot onto Elthlied soil!<$FFFE>
Kyah!<$FFFE>
We have to protect...<$FFFE>
W..What!?<$FFFC>
I couldn't be defeated by lowly demons...<$FFFE>
Your Excellency! Please withdraw from battle!<$FFFC>
Leave the rest to me!<$FFFE>
Forgive me, Varna.<$FFFE>
Diehärte's company...<$FFFC>
Here I come!<$FFFE>
Death is upon you!<$FFFE>
Taking me lightly because I'm a woman will be your last mistake!<$FFFE>
Laughable....<$FFFE>
I will not permit you to do with humanity as you please!<$FFFE>
Uh..Uh...<$FFFE>
Varna!<$FFFC>
You must retreat!<$FFFE>
B..But your Excellency...<$FFFE>
With that injury you can't fight effectively.<$FFFC>
Head to the sickbay and get those wounds treated.<$FFFD>
This is an order, Varna.<$FFFC>
I will not allow you to put yourself in such danger.<$FFFE>
Forgive me, YOur Excellency...<$FFFE>
You shall feel the wrath of the Empire!<$FFFE>
Such might...<$FFFE>
For the Empire!<$FFFE>
Your Excellency...<$FFFE>
Uuhh!<$FFFE>
Kyaaa!<$FFFE>
So cruel...<$FFFE>
Your Excellency, there is no excuse...<$FFFE>
W..Why did this...<$FFFE>
Urgh...<$FFFE>
Am I defeated!?<$FFFE>
Interesting.<$FFFC>
Who would ever thought that the Empire and Elthlied would team up like this.<$FFFD>
In any case, I've got to report this to Master Böser post-haste...<$FFFE>
Come human, groan a little bit for me.<$FFFE>
Such impudence!<$FFFE>
If only I was born a bird...<$FFFE>
GOOOOON!<$FFFE>
GOOOOON!<$FFFE>
GOOOOON!<$FFFE>
GYAAAA!<$FFFE>
GYAAAA!<$FFFE>
GYAAAA!<$FFFE>
GUGAA!<$FFFE>
GUGAA!<$FFFE>
Never could humans!?<$FFFE>
SUUUUUUU!<$FFFE>
SUUUUUUU!<$FFFE>
SUUUUUUU!<$FFFE>
GOOOOON!<$FFFE>
What, all my troops were wiped out!?<$FFFC>
Seems like even those insects got something to sting with.<$FFFE>
Alright, all demons have been taken care of.<$FFFE>
Your strategy was truly inspiring, Sir Diehärte.<$FFFE>
Sir Diehärte...<$FFFC>
............<$FFFD>
....I hate you<$FFFE>
If we humans cling together we mustn't be afraid of anything.<$FFFC>
And yet, I wonder if the senseless fighting will begin anew...<$FFFE>
True, but I don't think we'll have to worry about the Empire for now.<$FFFE>
That guy..Altemüller...our ally...<$FFFE>
That guy..Altemüller...our ally...<$FFFE>
Come on, he's not the worst there is.<$FFFE>
He's undoubtedly a skilled man and could proof to be of great assistance against the demons.<$FFFE>
King Sieghart, I appreciate your goodwill shown by agreeing to the truce.<$FFFE>
Those demons are a threat to all of us.<$FFFC>
Now let us move on to the formalities of signing the truce.<$FFFE>
W..What!?<$FFFE>
The demons of Velzeria in such a place!?<$FFFE>
Hm?<$FFFC>
It's not just Elthlied's but the Empire's troops too?<$FFFD>
He, that's fine.<$FFFC>
We'll just kill all of them.<$FFFE>
Impossible!<$FFFC>
That way we won't be able to end our ongoing battle.<$FFFE>
First the Empire and now Velzeria...<$FFFE>
...King Sieghart!<$FFFE>
What is it?<$FFFE>
We would like to suggest a truce.<$FFFE>
Your Excellency!?<$FFFE>
The demons of Velzeria aren't just any other fiend.<$FFFC>
We can continue our own dispute after we have dealt with them.<$FFFE>
What do you say?<$FFFC>
Will you agree to the truce?<$FFFE>
I need some time to consider.<$FFFE>
Do you wish to convey your opinion?<$FFFE>
Agree to the truce<$FFFE>
Resist to the bitter end<$FFFE>
Say nothing<$FFFE>
I consent to his suggestion.<$FFFD>
For now we should cooperate and focus on driving away those demons!<$FFFE>
...Certainly.<$FFFE>
This is not the time to fight amongst ourselves.<$FFFC>
I consent to your proposal.<$FFFE>
Surely, this isn't the best time for humans to compete with another.<$FFFD>
However, we cannot trust the people of the Rigüler Empire!<$FFFE>
Sir Diehärte!?<$FFFE>
...I disagree, this truce is a welcome concession.<$FFFC>
We shouldn't be the ones prolonging meaningless fighting, no?<$FFFD>
While Elthlied and the Empire wage war on each other, Velzeria gets the perfect chance to strike.<<$FFFD>
If we allow that, this whole world could fall under the rule of the demons.<$FFFC>
Such a risk cannot be taken for any reason.<$FFFE>
Sir Diehärte.<$FFFC>
It is as King Sieghart says.<$FFFD>
Now is not the time for humans to be at each others throat.<$FFFE>
Field Marshal Altemüller.<$FFFC>
I consent to your proposal.<$FFFE>
...Certainly.<$FFFE>
This is not the time to fight amongst ourselves.<$FFFC>
I consent to your proposal.<$FFFE>
Heh, that was quick.<$FFFE>
You heard him.<$FFFC>
All units, cease hostilities towards Elthlead.<$FFFE>
For now we'll cooperate with Elthlied and purge those demons!<$FFFE>
Yessir!<$FFFE>
Cooperate with the Empire!?<$FFFE>
To think we would cooperate with the Empire after all that has happened...<$FFFC>
But, I guess it was the more reasonable choice.<$FFFE>
Please do.<$FFFC>
Our real enemy were the demons all along.<$FFFE>
Humans fighting each other is such a pointless and tragic thing to do.<$FFFE>
Considering the strength and numbers of our enemies,<$FFFC>
cooperating at this point is the most advisable strategy.<$FFFE>
You can flock together as much as you want and still you're just insects before us.<$FFFC>
The triumph of darkness is set in stone.<$FFFE>
Diehärte I'm afraid this is the end of the road for you!<$FFFE>
You will find me a worthy opponent!<$FFFE>
<$FFFF>
