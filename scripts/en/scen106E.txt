Scenario ~ 33<$FFFC>
"Unwavering Loyalty" <$FFFE>
The cause for the insanity of King Wilder<$FFFC>
turned out to be Velzeria after all.<$FFFC>
Geriord who recovers to his true self temporarily, conveys the fact.<$FFFE>
To save his beloved Layla and to see her one last time, Geriord chooses to have the worm expelled from his body.<$FFFC>
But with the worm gone Geriord now has only little time left.<$FFFE>
In the meantime Altemüller has launched an attack on the city of Laffel.<$FFFC>
His demonic forces show no mercy to anyone in their way.<$FFFC>
Having to witness the massacre with his own eyes, Emaillink can no longer bear to side with the demons.<$FFFE>

Kill! Kill!<$FFFC>
Slaughter to your hearts content!<$FFFE>
Gaaooo!<$FFFE>
Guaargh!<$FFFE>
Kyaaahhh!<$FFFE>
Stop this!<$FFFD>
I won't stand idly by, while you massacre innocent citizens!<$FFFE>
Emaillink, don't tell me you would betray master Böser?<$FFFE>
He is no longer the lord Altemüller I hold in highest esteem.<$FFFC>
Right now it pains me just to look at him.<$FFFE>
Merciful it would be to strike down Altemüller, if this is what it takes to release him from this evil curse!<$FFFE>
Swayed by emotions, you are blind to real power...foolish human..<$FFFE>
Rag, what is this hold up about?<$FFFE>
Yes, Master Böser.<$FFFC>
It seems that Emaillink wishes to rebel against you.<$FFFE>
...Is that true Emaillink?<$FFFE>
Your Excellency, you have changed.<$FFFC>
I can follow your ways no more.<$FFFE>
Let me offer you a peaceful slumber as my last service.<$FFFE>
So you are serious.<$FFFC>
Well then, show me the extent of your resolve.<$FFFE>
...Your Excellency.<$FFFE>
