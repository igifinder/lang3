It's a serious matter.<$FFFE>
Cheer up!<$FFFE>
This isn't like you!<$FFFE>
Yes.<$FFFC>
It's a heavy responsibility.....<$FFFE>

We've got to do this.<$FFFE>
You're right.<$FFFC>
I..I'll do my best!<$FFFE>
You don't need to look at this so seriously.<$FFFC>
Cheer up.<$FFFE>
Oh my, you're not worried at all?<$FFFE>

What do you reply?<$FFFE>
I was too flippant.<$FFFE>
Sorry, sorry.<$FFFE>
The truth.<$FFFE>
Forgive me, I was too flippant.<$FFFC>
I'm also worried about it.....<$FFFE>
.............<$FFFE>
So doubts have started to plague you, eh.<$FFFE>
Riffany.....<$FFFE>
Oh my.<$FFFC>
Where's that confident voice you always use to calm our doubts?<$FFFD>
Come on, we'll win for sure, right?<$FFFE>
Right.<$FFFE>
Sorry, sorry.<$FFFC>
I didn't mean it; I just wanted to see you smile.<$FFFD>
I don't know if you've realized it yet, but your smile is what dispels my doubts and sets me at ease.<$FFFE>
Y..you can't mean.....<$FFFE>
Don't worry.<$FFFC>
We'll win for sure.<$FFFE>
R..right......<$FFFE>
