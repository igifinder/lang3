By putting up all his bravery, [diehardt's name] confessed that he loved her as a woman.<$FFFD>
Being struck by surprise at first, Tiaris was overjoyed soon; never had she dared to hope to be something more to him than a sibling.<$FFFE>
The newly found joy didn't last long, since the resurrected Geier kidnapped Tiaris shortly after.<$FFFC>

After their victory, Tiaris was taken in by the Claus family, but eventually married Lewin who had become the King of Elthlied.<$FFFD>
Although being happily married, there still was a grain of sadness left in her heart.<$FFFD>
Never had she told her older brother that she felt more for him than relatives do.<$FFFC>

His malicious intention was to sacrifice Riffany to Chaos, the deity of destruction.<$FFFD>
Up to the very end did she believe in [diehardt's name] to come for her...<$FFFD>
When Chaos revived, her soul fell into eternal darkness.<$FFFC>
Cursing himself, [diehardt's name] followed his only one shortly after...<$FFFE>
Against all odds [diehardt's name] rescued her from the clutches of evil.<$FFFD>
After peace was restored, the two of them settled down in the Capitol as a married couple.<$FFFC>

After a while she began experimenting with spells of great destructive power.<$FFFD>
One day one of those spells failed horribly resulting in her body being evaporated, leaving behind not even the smallest trace...<$FFFE>
After their victory she returned to her parents in the Capitol to do research on magic and demon kind.<$FFFE>
In order to spread the benefits of magic she invented numerous easy to use spells to help people lead a better life.<$FFFC>
As a result the revolution of magic occurred.<$FFFD>
The book about magic theory that Riffany wrote, was recognized as the foundation of modern magic.<$FFFC>
Despite her many achievements she often carried an expression of lonesomeness on her face.<$FFFD>
Although attracting men and women alike, none could meet her requirements, for there was only one man she was thinking of...one that had rescued her and the world alike...<$FFFE>
Eventually she began experimenting with spells of great destructive power.<$FFFD>
One day one of those spells failed horribly.<$FFFC>

During their travels he grew from a boy into a dependable knight.<$FFFD>
He served the Elthlied Royal devotedly and was promoted to be captain of the knights.<$FFFE>
Pierre performed admirably on the field of battle.<$FFFD>
Finally he became the knight he always wanted to be and served the Elthlied Royal Family.<$FFFE>
But those who trust their own power to much live dangerously.<$FFFD>
The last thing that was heard of him was that he wanted to join the quest to extinct the dragons.<$FFFE>
After seeing the horrors of war for himself he wished for a more peaceful life.<$FFFC>
He abandoned the way of the knight and succeeded his parent's bar.<$FFFD>

After days of struggling he finally closed his eyes forever...<$FFFE>
Being the daughter of the genius strategos Torrand, Luna received education in all manners of warfare from an early age.<$FFFE>
Not only her mind but also her blade was as sharp as a razor and many claim that Elthlied's victory was only possible due to her relentless efforts.<$FFFE>
Compared to her strategies her swordskills were nothing grand.<$FFFE>
In the course of many battles Luna developed a rather strong affinity towards [diehardt's name].<$FFFD>
When [diehardt's name], in a surge of bravery confessed his love to her, she almost didn't believe her ears.<$FFFC>
This was a true stroke of luck, since she surely would've stayed silent by herself.<$FFFE>
But their happiness ended abruptly when Geier kidnapped Luna shortly after.<$FFFC>
Geier's despicable motives were to sacrifice Luna to the evil deity Chaos.<$FFFD>
Until her last breath she waited sternly for [diehardt's name] to come for her...<$FFFD>
Upon the revival of Chaos, her soul disappeared...<$FFFC>
Hating himself for being too weak, [diehardt's name] took his own life to be with Luna once again...<$FFFE>
After the war ended Luna didn't return to her Father's lands but decided to serve the Elthlied Royal Family.<$FFFE>
For some years Luna tagged along with [diehardt's name] but then settled to teach a new generation of strategists.<$FFFD>
Peace didn't last long in Elthlied as the small country was still being watched by many greedy eyes.<$FFFD>
But with her unmatched strategies and [diehardt's name] as backup, only minor incidents occurred and were solved without any serious bloodshed.<$FFFD>
For long years to come minstrels would praise their outstanding heroism in their songs.$FFFE>
But it was a life without love.<$FFFC>
Still being malcontent with his abilities, [diehardt's name] set out on a journey to mature.<$FFFD>
Several years later a massive horde of demons threatened the Elthlied border.<$FFFC>
Luna headed out to stop the enemy's advance herself but was overwhelmed by their sheer numbers.<$FFFD>
When everything seemed hopeless a lone man using two blades rushed to their aide, saving not only their lives but also the country.<$FFFD>
Living her life alone, Luna regretted to have been unable to admit her true feelings to [diehardt's name].<$FFFE>
Several years later Luna accompanies [diehardt's name] again for a while, but ultimately settles down to give lessons on strategy.<$FFFD>
Peace didn't last long in Elthlied as the small country was still being watched by many greedy eyes.<$FFFD>
But with her unmatched strategies those minor incidents were solved without any serious bloodshed.<$FFFC>

Several years later a massive horde of demons threatened the Elthlied border.<$FFFC>
Luna headed out to stop the enemy's advance herself but was overwhelmed by their sheer numbers.<$FFFD>
And thus with the last determined charge of the demons her short life came to an end...<$FFFC>
[diehardt's name] laments the loss of a good friend...<$FFFE>
After the war ended Luna didn't return to her Father's lands but decided to serve the Elthlied Royal Family.<$FFFE>
The time she spent fighting alongside [diehardt's name] remained her most treasured memory.<$FFFE>
The great sage and devoted follower of Lushiris, Fauvel, watched over Lushiris eastern gate for a long time.<$FFFE>
He joined [diehardt's name]'s cause and proved himself to be of great use due to his vast knowledge and magical powers.<$FFFE>
For his contribution in the establishment of peace he was appointed to be High Priest.<$FFFD>
He spent the rest of his life spreading his belief of Lushiris and the importance to maintain peace.<$FFFD>
His good deeds would be remembered long past his time and people spoke of him only as a saint.<$FFFE>
To honor his efforts during the war, Fauvel was invited to serve the Elthlied Royal Family.<$FFFD>
However he humbly declined the offer and returned to his quiet life to protect Lushiris gate.<$FFFD>
And one day he passed away peacefully, only regretting to never have been able to behold his beloved daughter Sophia in a brides dress.<$FFFE>
Despite his high age he was a valuable member of the diversion, be it in battle or as an advisor.<$FFFE>
To honor his efforts during the war, Fauvel was invited to serve the Elthlied Royal Family.<$FFFD>

And so one day he passed away peacefully, never being able to behold his beloved daughter Sophia in a brides dress.<$FFFE>
Sophia, daughter of the great sage Fauvel and guardian of Lushiris southern gate.<$FFFD>
After she was saved from a cruel sacrificial ritual of the Shika Tribe, she joined [diehardt's name]'s quest for peace.<$FFFE>
Her healing magic not only earned her the title of goddess among the Shika's, but also saved her companions innumerable times.<$FFFC>
Despising violence, it was pity not hate that filled her heart when she had to go into battle.<$FFFE>
Many times those who were injured depended on her healing abilities.<$FFFE>
Over time her heart blossomed, being attracted to one man only.<$FFFC>
Her prayers were answered and the one she longed for confessed his love to her.<$FFFE>
If it hadn't been for Geier who kidnapped Sophia, she and [diehardt's name] could've enjoy bliss from now on.<$FFFC>
Geier's despicable motives were to sacrifice Sophia to Chaos, the god of drakness.<$FFFD>
To the very end Sophia believed that [diehardt's name] would come for her, but her hopes were in vain...<$FFFD>
With the revival of Chaos, her soul plunged into eternal darkness.<$FFFC>
[diehardt's name] going mad at his own weakness, ultimately takes his own life to be with his loved one once more.<$FFFE>
Eventually the war ended and peace returned to the lands.<$FFFC>
But the damage done during the war was severe.<$FFFE>
[diehardt's name] and Sophia made a happy home for themselves and many children who were made orphans during the war.<$FFFD>
Years went by and Elthlied grew even more prosperous than Larcuss ever had.<$FFFC>
Not few think that what she and others of her kind where the ones who made this possibly with their unconditional altruism.<$FFFD>

Those who were raised by those two grew up to be good people who worked hard to make Elthlied a better place for everyone.<$FFFC>
However, the injuries she received in battles long past got back at her and so she passed away at a cruelly young age.<$FFFD>
Even during her last moments Sophia asked nothing of the ones present but to lead a happy life and parted with a gentle smile.<$FFFE>
[diehardt's name] thinking himself to be still to immature went on a journey. Sophia built an orphanage, ever awaiting his return.<$FFFD>
Simply watching them grow filled her heart with joy, but missing [diehardt's name] wore her out.<$FFFD>
She used all her energy to raise the children to be good people but one day she had none left to live herself...<$FFFE>
During their shared time she developed a rather strong affection towards [diehardt's name].<$FFFC>
But her prayers remained unanswered.<$FFFD>
In order to distract herself and to sooth her aching heart she traveled the lands to aide those who had suffered during the war.<$FFFE>

His beastly strength and unmatched fluffiness were of great importance for Elthlied's success on the battlefield.<$FFFD>
When the battles came to an end, Jügler returned to the western gate to act as a guardian once more.<$FFFC>
Waiting for him was a suspicious silhouette...<$FFFD>
To Jügler's ineffable surprise it turned out, that it was a female saintly animal which he believed to have become extinct...<$FFFD>

But unfortunately it seems like someone didn't recognized his potential and neglected to use him.<$FFFD>
Frustrated and disappointed he returned to the western gate.<$FFFC>
Feeling useless Jügler begins to grow lazy and corpulent.<$FFFD>
When his friends came to visit they were so shocked that they order him to do a strict diet and work out.<$FFFC>
Now his daily training includes letting all children of the village ride him, which makes the little rascals very happy...Jügler not so much...<$FFFE>
Dios, a former general of Barral deserted due to the insanity of King Wilder and joined [diehardt's name]'s division.<$FFFE>

After their victory Dios returned to Barral to reconstruct the Kingdom which still was in shambles.<$FFFE>
Once order was restored in Barral and Dios was being elected to become the new supreme commander of the Barral army.<$FFFD>
He would be remembered as the unbreakable backbone of Barral.<$FFFE>
In one of the many battles Dios suffered an injury on the arm and became unable to lift a sword.<$FFFC>
This marked the end of Dios's fighting days.<$FFFD>
When order was restored in Barral, Dios set out on a journey stating only that he would be searching for a new life.<$FFFE>
Although being a war veteran, Dios never was given the chance to show his potential.<$FFFD>

Nonetheless Dios kept up his work and did everything he could to help those around him.<$FFFC>
And one day all their anguish towards him was gone and made room for a different feeling, gratefulness.<$FFFD>
After Barral stabilized he was reinstated as General.<$FFFC>
He would go down as the finest General Barral had ever seen.<$FFFE>
Dios worked his bones off to make Barral better than ever.<$FFFC>
Upon visiting the site of the still being reconstructed castle a giant boulder drops and buries Dios beneath it.<$FFFD>
No one knows if it really was an accident or...<$FFFE>
The city of Laffel is home to the self proclaimed righteousness robber silver wolf, which helped [diehardt's name] to overcome the occupation of the Barral Kingdom.<$FFFD>
During their travels he makes friends with Lewin who offers him a position as a spy and diplomat.<$FFFE>
Apart from excelling in battle, his ability to gather information fast and efficiently made him and his many followers valuable allies for Elthlied.<$FFFE>
When the war ended, he offered his services to the Elthlied Royal family.<$FFFD>
Combining peace-oriented diplomacy with an invisibly working information network paid off more than anyone would've hoped for.<$FFFD>

His example of combining stealth and diplomacy became a role model for many potent agents to come...<$FFFE>
His ability to gather information fast and efficiently made him and his many followers a valuable ally for Elthlied.<$FFFD>

Knowing that [diehardt's name] would be a just ruler for the country she now has to leave behind, she died with smile on her face...<$FFFE>
Despite wanting to be together with Flaire, [diehardt's name] decides to go on a journey to mature.<$FFFD>
While waiting for her beloved to come back, Flaire returned to Barral to rebuild the devastated Kingdom.<$FFFD>
But the citizens still held a grudge against her, for their suffering caused by the insane Wilder and the reconstruction only progresses slowly.<$FFFD>
When [diehardt's name] finally returned as a new man, he did everything to aide Flaire.<$FFFD>
Together they manage to establish order once more and led their country to great prosperity.<$FFFE>
After the war ended, Flaire returned to Barral to help rebuild the Kingdom her father left in disorder.<$FFFD>
As the new queen she worked hard to create a better life for her people, being supported by the reinstated General Dios.<$FFFE>
After long months of seemingly endless labour, order finally returns to the devastated country.<$FFFE>
Although many princes and men of noble heritage try their luck, Flaire turns them down rather determined and stays the absolute and sole ruler.<$FFFD>
The only man that ever had a place in her heart was [diehardt's name].<$FFFE>
Despite her solitude Flaire went down into history as the fairest and most caring queen Barral ever had.<$FFFE>
Although Elthlied supported Barral's rebuild in every way possible, it never reached its former glory,<$FFFE>
resulting from her unanswered love towards [diehardt's name].<$FFFD>
Unable to concentrate on matters at hand it seemed the land suffered with his queen.<$FFFD>
Today the tragic queen of Barral has become the stuff of legend.<$FFFC>
When the companions parted ways it was as if Flaire had become unable to smile...<$FFFE>
Hiding her feelings, she made an effort to learn how to govern a country.<$FFFC>
While forcing herself to put up a brave front, no one truly understood her hearts sorrow.<$FFFD>
Even though Barral flourished, happiness did not return to Flaire. <$FFFE>
Flaire who couldn't bare her agony anymore threw herself into a lake to give up her life.<$FFFD>
Each time the evening sun sets her image floats over the lake, being only visible to [diehardt's name]'s tear-filled eyes...<$FFFE>
Ever hoping he could turn back time...<$FFFC>
In order to protect the Shika Tribe it was Do Kahni who joined Sophia on her quest for peace.<$FFFE>
His bravery and wildness in battle made his enemies shiver in fear and proved him worthy of his title as a hero.<$FFFD>
After having fought many battles together, all his comrades acknowledge him as a true hero.<$FFFD>
For his many feats he was chosen to be the successor of the great chief.<$FFFE>
No one doubted his bravery in battle but he could've been  active a little bit more.<$FFFD>
Being together with outsiders for so long didn't please everyone in the tribe.<$FFFD>
Despite that he was chosen to be the successor of the great chief.<$FFFE>
Being not very intelligent and always charging the enemy, he suffered many injuries during the countless battles he fought.<$FFFE>
Still he was a great help in the War-effort and earned himself the title of "Hero of mankind".<$FFFD>
After the war ended, he returned to the Shika tribe only to find his home being under attack by monsters.<$FFFD>
Paying the ultimate price for protecting his kin, he died a true hero's death.<$FFFE>
Despite calling himself a hero he seemed useless in real battle.<$FFFD>
Making his way back home in frustration, he was ambushed by monsters.<$FFFC>
That's the last thing known about him.<$FFFE>
Among the four Imperial Generals there's one famed for his refined intellect, his name being Emaillink.<$FFFD>
He allied with [diehardt's name] to rescue his Lord Altemüller from the evil bewitchment of Alhazard.<$FFFE>
However the hopes for rescuing Altemüller were slim.<$FFFC>
His attempt to reach Altemüller's heart fail and the same dies in the aftermath.<$FFFD>
Emaillink who couldn't rescue Altemüller returned to the Empire and made every effort to manage the postwar confusion.<$FFFD>
Unfortunately he wasn't able to reinstate order throughout the giant country.<$FFFC>
But because there was no legitimate successor for the throne the quarrels among the nobles gave rise to a full-scale rebellion.<$FFFE>
Only with combined efforts was it possible to save the obsessed Altemüller.<$FFFE>
Since Altemüller and Varna set out on a journey, it was Emmailink's task to take care of affairs of the state in their absence.<$FFFC>
Being gifted with a brilliant intellect, he proved himself to be highly capable to handle governmental affairs.<$FFFD>
He managed to improve the citizens life significantly by applying new methods of agriculture and trade with other nations.<$FFFE>
Since Altemüller and Varna set out on a journey,<$FFFC>
it was his task to take care of affairs of the state in their absence.<$FFFC>
Although being gifted intellectually, governing a gigantic country was to much to handle for him alone.<$FFFD>
Due to the constant support from Elthlied peace and order could be maintained.<$FFFC>
As of late there have been reports of him being in bad health evermore waiting for Altemüller's return..<$FFFE>
Altemüller the highly skilled and decorated Field Marshal of the Rigüler Empire, took up Alhazard, to avenge the death of his beloved Varna.<$FFFE>
Having his heart filled with only anger and hatred he became the Prince of Darkness, Böser.<$FFFC>
However [diehardt's name] and company defeated him and sealed away Alhazard once more.<$FFFD>
After all it was not possible for [diehardt's name] to rescue Altemüller's soul.<$FFFD>
His heart had been already consumed by his hatred<$FFFD>
and the demonic sword had changed him beyond repair.<$FFFC>
Upon asking for reasons,<$FFFC>
the cursed sword remains silent....<$FFFE>
Having his heart filled with only anger and hatred he became Böser temporally but returned to his true self thanks to powers of the Langrisser.<$FFFD>
Afterwards he allied with [diehardt's name] in order to defeat Paul, who had become the new Böser.<$FFFD>
But even after the battle was won, there was no time for him to take a breath.<$FFFC>
His most beloved Varna had been resurrected by the power of darkness that was fading from the world, thus threatening her very existence.<$FFFD>
To find a way to restore Varna's humanity, they set out on a journey into the unknown.<$FFFE>
Several years after peace had been established, it occurred that a Rigüler division was attacked by remnants of the demon tribe.<$FFFD>
The ambushed division was heavily outnumbered and prepared for a fight to the bitter end.<$FFFC>
Out of nowhere a man and a women appear and annihilate all the demons with seemingly ease.<$FFFD>
Emaillink who rushes to the aid of the ambushed, utters the following, as he beholds the soldiers saviors, while tears swell up in his eyes...<$FFFC>
"Welcome back your Excellency."<$FFFE>
After many years the two of them still didn't return.<$FFFC>
And maybe they have to continue their aimless journey forever...<$FFFE>
Varna, known as one of the four Imperial Generals and Altemüller's beloved adjutant.<$FFFD>
Shortly after rescuing her little Sister who had been kidnapped by Böser, Varna gives her own life to protect Altemüller from being assassinated by Geier.<$FFFC>
However, Altemüller gave new life to her by applying the powers of darkness.<$FFFE>
When the true Böser was defeated she set out on a journey with his Excellency Altemüller.<$FFFE>
After long years of aimless traveling, a method to restore her humanity was finally found and the two of them lived in happiness ever after, enjoying their lives to the fullest.<$FFFE>
After long years of aimless traveling, a method to restore her humanity still couldn't be found and so her life faded away.<$FFFD>
The time she spent traveling with the man she loved was the happiest time of her life.<$FFFC>
During her dying moments she thanked Altemüller for his love and promised to meet him in her next life...<$FFFE>
Dreaming of becoming a knight since childhood, it was, [diehardt's name], who surpassed even his own wishes and became a hero amongst heroes.<$FFFC>
Not only did he play a major role in restoring the ruined Kingdom of Larcuss and re-establishing peace throughout the world, but also protected all of humankind from the demon's invasion.<$FFFE>
[diehardt's name] who had confessed his love to his chosen Tiaris, was overjoyed to realize that his love was returned.<$FFFE>
[diehardt's name] who had confessed his love to his chosen Riffany, was overjoyed to realize that his love was returned.<$FFFE>
[diehardt's name] who had confessed his love to his chosen Luna, was overjoyed to realize that his love was returned.<$FFFE>
[diehardt's name] who had confessed his love to his chosen Sophia, was overjoyed to realize that his love was returned.<$FFFE>
[diehardt's name] who had confessed his immortal love to his chosen Flaire, was overjoyed to realize that his love was returned.<$FFFE>
Their happiness didn't last long, since she was being sacrificed for the revival of Chaos.<$FFFE>
Even though [diehardt's name] was able to defeat Chaos in a battle of epical scale, the wounds his heart had suffered tore him apart from within.<$FFFE>
[diehardt's name], the hero who brought back peace could no longer stay in Elthlied.<$FFFC>
He departed for journey without sense or direction, for his body had become an empty shell since the one he loved was no more...<$FFFE>
Although she was kidnapped to be a sacrifice for the revival of Chaos, [diehardt's name] came to her rescue and defeated Paul in a battle of mythical scale.<$FFFE>
From now on the reunited lovers cherished every single moment together and enjoyed happiness for as long as they lived .<$FFFE>
...And this concludes the story of the rise of the fabled Kingdom Elthlied.<$FFFC>
At that time no one imagined that those events were merely a prologue to an even greater story.<$FFFE>
For the legend surrounding the Langrisser had only just begun...<$FFFE>
Even though [diehardt's name] longed for many women, he kept his feelings locked away inside his heart of iron.<$FFFE>
Even though [diehardt's name] confessed his sincere love, he was rejected and despised.<$FFFE>
After their victory [diehardt's name] lost his will to live and went on a journey to find a nice place to die.<$FFFC>
Altemüller who had turned into Böser, couldn't be saved and lost his life during battle.<$FFFE>
Thereupon [diehardt's name] decided to go on a journey to become a become a better man.<$FFFE>
In order to spread the benefits of magic she invented numerous easy to use spells to help people lead a better life.<$FFFC>
As a result the revolution of magic occurred.<$FFFD>
The book about magic theory that Riffany wrote, was recognized as the foundation of modern magic.<$FFFE>
The book about magic theory that Riffany wrote, was recognized as the foundation of modern magic.<$FFFC>
While she was serving Elthlied she finished Volume one.<$FFFD>
Due to this book she would be referred to as the "Goddess of Battle" even long after her time.<$FFFE>
Several years later a massive horde of demons threatens the Elthlied border.<$FFFC>
Luna heads out to stop the enemy's advance herself but is overwhelmed by their sheer numbers.<$FFFD>
And thus with the last determined charge of the demons her short life came to an end...<$FFFE>
Several years later Elthlied enjoyed prosperity even greater than Larcuss had known.<$FFFC>
Not few think that what she and others of her kind where the ones who made this possibly with their unconditional altruism.<$FFFE>
However, the injuries she received in battles long past got back at her and so she passed away at a cruelly young age.<$FFFD>
Even during her last moments Sophia asked nothing of the ones present but to lead a happy life and parted with a gentle smile.<$FFFE>
Long years passed and a rumor appeared saying that ALtemüller had fallen to darkness.<$FFFC>
Those who knew him had no doubt that if this was true he did it only to save poor Varna.<$FFFD>
It said that he and a certain women were traveling the lands aimlessly...<$FFFE>
Their journey reached a tragic end after long years of hardship.<$FFFC>
Varna's body couldn't stay alive after most of the dark power had vanished.<$FFFD>
And so one day right before Altemüller's eyes she turned to dust and was carried off by the wind leaving no trace behind.<$FFFE>
